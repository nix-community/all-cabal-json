Name:                mysnapsession
Version:             0.3
Synopsis:            Sessions and continuations for Snap web apps
Description:         This package provides two Snap extensions, implementing
                     sessions as either memory-backed arbitrary types, or as
                     client-side cookie-backed serializable types.  The latter
                     uses the @clientsession@ package to encrypt the cookie for
                     security.  In both extensions, sessions are protected from
                     session stealing by checking the source IP address, and
                     have a configurable timeout (optional for the cookie-
                     backed back end).  The session type is user-defined.
                     .
                     In addition, a library is provided for a continuation-
                     based programming model called dialogues, which allows
                     natural specification of stateful interactions with the
                     client that span multiple requests.  Because the session
                     type is not serializable, this requires the memory-backed
                     implementation.
