Name:                mysnapsession
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            Memory-backed sessions and continuations for Snap web apps
Description:         This package provides two Snap extensions.  The first is
                     an in-memory session manager, which stores sessions for
                     each client.  The session object type is user-defined.
                     Because sessions are memory-backed, sticky session routing
                     is needed to use this extension with load balancing.
                     .
                     The second extension provides a continuation-based
                     programming model called dialogues, which allow natural
                     specification of stateful interactions with the client
                     that span multiple requests.
