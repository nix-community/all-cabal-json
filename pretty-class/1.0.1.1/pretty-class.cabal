Synopsis:	Pretty printing class similar to Show.
Stability:      experimental
Build-type:	Simple
Description:	Pretty printing class similar to Show, based on the HughesPJ
                pretty printing library.  Provides the pretty printing class
                and instances for the Prelude types.  This upload replaces the
                old pretty-class package (which I believe nobody is using) with
                a copy of Lennart's prettyclass package with a small change to
                its Char instance.
