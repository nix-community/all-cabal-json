synopsis:            Compiler plugin for loop unrolling
description:
  This plugin gives an example of defining a compiler plugin for
  GHC. You mark functions with the `Strictify` annotation and GHC
  makes the function strict (by recursively expanding non-recursive
  let bindings into case bindings.)
