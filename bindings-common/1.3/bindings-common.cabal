synopsis:
  Preprocessor combinator library for low level FFI.
description: 
  Packages named @bindings-*@ contain low level bindings to well
  known libraries, as a resource to be used by developers of
  higher level modules. This @bindings-common@ package provides
  @hsc2hs@ macros that allows writing code for such low level
  bindings that is easy to read and maintain, while keeping names
  and functionality as close as possible to the base library.
  These macros can be used as a simple alternative to, say,
  @c2hs@, or to @hsc2hs@ original macros. At this moment, there's
  no good documentation on how to use them, so please
  read the code for "Bindings.C" to understand how they work, or
  just fill question\/sugestion reports in the bug tracking web
  site.
