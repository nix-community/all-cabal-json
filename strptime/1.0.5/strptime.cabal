Synopsis: 
  Efficient parsing of LocalTime using a binding to C's strptime, 
  with some extra features (i.e. fractional seconds)
Description:
  This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows to parse 
  dates and times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library
  creates LocalTime values. It provides some extra features which 
  the original strptime lacks - parsing of fractional seconds and parsing
  of ten-powers of seconds since epoch (for example milliseconds since epoch).
