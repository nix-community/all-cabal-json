synopsis:           lexical style suggestions for source code
description:
  scan checks the format of your source code. It reports
  (and partly repairs if given the @-@ option):

  non-ascii characters,
  tabs or carriage returns,
  trailing white spaces,
  backslash at line end,
  unconventional comment delimiters,
  too long lines,
  too many consecutive blank lines,
  not a single blank between tokens,
  not a single final newline,
  no spaces after commas,
  spaces between parens and infix operators in sections,
  bad layout (wrt @do@ or @of@).

  It may be useful in conjunction with
  <http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/>
  to give suggestions on how to improve your source code.

  Repairing is not suited for slices (aka @$(...)@) in template haskell or if
  you like to align your code at @=@ or @->@ in the middle of a line (thus
  wanting multiple blanks). Furthermore layout may be destroyed by inserting
  or deleting blanks, but this is an indication for improving layout anyway.
  Also lines may become too long after inserting blanks.
