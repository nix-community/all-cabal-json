synopsis:           Build system library, like Make, but properly supports generated files.
description:
    /WARNING/: Shake has only been lightly tested, and there will be bugs (please report them).
    The interface is likely to change, although hopefully not significantly. It would be unwise
    to build a critical production system on top of the current version of Shake.
    .
    Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
    replacement for make. To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program
    that imports the Shake library, defines some build rules, and calls
    shake. Thanks to do notation and infix operators, a simple Shake program
    is not too dissimilar from a simple Makefile. However, as build systems
    get more complex, Shake is able to take advantage of the excellent
    abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily support much larger
    projects.
    .
    The Shake library provides all the standard features available in other
    build systems, including automatic parallelism and minimal rebuilds.
    Shake provides highly accurate dependency tracking, including seamless
    support for generated files, and dependencies on system information
    (i.e. compiler version). Shake will eventually be able to produce profile reports, indicating
    which files and take longest to build, and providing an analysis of the
    parallelism.
    .
    The theory behind an old version of Shake is described in a video at
    <http://vimeo.com/15465133>, and an example is given at the top of
    "Development.Shake". Some further examples are included in the Cabal tarball,
    under the @Examples@ directory.
