description:
                The algorithm implemented here-in provides extended RNA
                secondary structure prediction. Each predicted nucleotide
                pairing is extended with an annotation describing which of
                three nucleotide edges is engaged in the pairing. In addition,
                each nucleotide may be engaged in more than one pairing.

                Please note that "experimental" does mean experimental. We are
                mostly concerned with determining a good set of (heuristic)
                rules for run-time reduction currently. This version does
                include stacking and is able to fold sequences of a few hundred
                nucleotides in seconds.
                .
                Triplet calculations will come back with the next version (in a
                few days). The recursions require a number of changes to keep
                the runtimes down (as has been done for the extended loops
                without triplets).
                .
                We have recently split the Biohaskell libraries into smaller
                individual libraries. In addition, stacking, intermediate
                arrays, fusion and newtype-wrapping did require a number of
                changes. Please send a mail, if you encounter strange behaviour
                or bugs.

                Changes in 0.3.2.0
                .
                * simpler training wrapper
                .
                * added parallelism option for multi-core systems (reduce
                  iteration time for the cost of a possible reduction in
                  training efficiency; but should be worth it)
                .
                Changes in 0.3.1.0
                .
                * fixed bugs introduced by bulge/interior/multi-loops
