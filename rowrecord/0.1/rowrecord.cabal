description:
  Given rows of @String@ data with column headings, this library will create
  values of user-defined record types.  Records can contain mandatory or
  optional fields of any type, subject to a class constraint.
  Heading names and and record construction code are derived using
  Template Haskell.
  .
  One use case for this library is parsing records from a CSV file.  A
  parser from CSV to @[[String]]@ is not included, but there are several
  suitable packages on Hackage.
  .
  The emphasis of this library is on simplicity of use rather than performance.
  It is likely to be suitable for a hundred thousand rows, but not many
  millions.  A future version may support packed input formats like
  @ByteString@ or @Text@.  Suggestions and patches are welcome.
