Name:                simple-rope
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Memory-efficient strings with concatenation and splitting.
Description:         A very simple but rather memory- and performance-efficient rope with logarithmic concatenation, access and splitting at an index or predicate. Differs from the current "rope" package (as of rope 0.6.1) by providing guaranteed logarithmic performance.
