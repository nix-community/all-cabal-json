synopsis:
  Low level bindings supporting GObject and derived libraries.
description:
  This package contains bindings to GObject library using
  bindings-DSL macros and style. Like GObject, it's
  not useful by itself, but as a foundation for other
  libraries making use of its type system. Besides
  GObject functionality, it also provides a few macros
  for easy mapping of code following recomended conventions.
