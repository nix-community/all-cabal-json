description:        This package is not the successor to th-typegraph-0.43, it is
                    a brand new package which forms the basis of a new package that
                    what will eventually do what th-typegraph was supposed to.  What
                    it *can* do is traverse the type "TypeQ", and includes versions
                    of deriveSafeCopy and derivePathInfo that use the traversal to
                    avoid adding phantom types to the context of the instance.
