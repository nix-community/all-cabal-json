synopsis: A grep-like tool for filtering on words or lines.
description: The 'only' command-line tool lets you search based
 on word patterns or line patterns like never before! Not only can
 you search with 'only -l patt' but you can select the n-th match
 with '-l n\/patt\/' and the next 3 lines with '-l \/patt\/0:3'.
