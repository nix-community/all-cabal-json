CATEGORY:       GUI, Game
SYNOPSIS:       The "Haskell Applets" Gtk+ ver. 2 back-end for "happlets".

DESCRIPTION:   
    .
    *WARNING:* There are still some known bugs in this package, it is being
    uploaded to Hackage for evaluation purposes only. Although it is being
    actively developed, there is no release schedule for a production-ready
    version of this package. Contributions to the repository on GitHub are
    welcome.
    .
    This packages provides the Gtk+ v2 back-end to the "happlets" GUI
    framework. To create a Gtk+ applet, import the "Happlets.Lib.Gtk"
    module. "Happlets.Lib.Gtk" re-exports the "Happlets" module, so you can
    use all of the primitives provided by the "Happlets" module to construct
    your applet. In your "main" function, launch the main event loop by
    passing the 'Happlets.Lib.Gtk.gtkHapplet' function as the "Provider"
    either to the 'Happlets.Initialize.happlet' function or to the
    'Happlets.Initialize.simpleHapplet' function.
    .
    For an example of how to program your own Happlet, run the "cabal
    configure" command with the "--enable-tests" flag set. This will build
    the "Happlets.Lib.Gtk.TestSuite" executable program. Refer to the source
    code for "TestSuite" to see how the application is structured.
    .
    The goal of the Happlets project is to allow you to create very simple,
    thread-safe applications that contain nothing more than a single window
    with a drawing canvas that can respond to user input events, like mouse
    clicks, key-presses, or frame animation events. The intention is to
    create a minimal programming platform for small, single-purpose
    graphical applications which simply displays some interactive graphic,
    for example a plot of some data, or a simple game. Naturally, the
    Happlet program can be arbitrarily complex, but it may be better to
    consider other, FRP-based solutions if managing events becomes too
    difficult.
