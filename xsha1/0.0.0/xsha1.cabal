synopsis: cryptanalysis of Blizzard's broken SHA-1 implementation.
description:
        Caution: XSHA1 is weak, and should not be used as a hash.
        .
        XSHA1 is used in password and CD key authentication in older Blizzard games
        (Starcraft, Diablo 2) among other things. The fact that it's cryptographically
        weak has been known for years: this is a public analysis of the weakness. The
        goal is to determine risk posed to users, and find safeguards if possible.
        .
        .
        The code is geared for rapid interactive development with GHCI. Excuse the lax conventions.
        .
        Data.Digest.* implements and explores XSHA1, while Data.Codec.* contains applications.
