Synopsis:               Test your 'Aeson' 'Serialize' and 'Binary' instances for stability over time
Description:            
                        When I am programming haskell I write a lot of
                        @
                        instance ToJSON ... where
                        instance FromJSON ... where
                        instance Binary ... where
                        @
                        These libraries are often associated with state.

                        So, I end up writing a lot of tests of the form ...

                        >>> expect (encode someTestAeson) `toBe` "{\"someSerializedThing\":\"expected encoding\"}

                        so I have to write all these pieces down... but what I would really like is



                        >>> runAesonSerializeTest someTestAeson outputfile.txt


                        That is what these libraries do for Serialize, Binary and Aeson
                        They make very little assumption about what version of the library you are using.
