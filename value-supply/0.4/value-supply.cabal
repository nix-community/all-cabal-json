Synopsis: A library for generating values without having to thread state.
Description:
  This library can be used to generate values (for example, new names)
  without the need to thread state.  This means that functions that
  need to generate new values only need a supply object as an argument,
  and they do not need to return a new supply object as a result.
  This decreases the number of data-dependencies in a program, which
  makes it easier to exploit parallelism.

  The technique for generating new values is based on the paper
  ''On Generating Unique Names''
  by Lennart Augustsson, Mikael Rittri, and Dan Synek.
