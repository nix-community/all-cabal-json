description:              Implementation of natural numbers and integers by a
                          binary representation. All functions are supposed to
                          be as non-strict as possible. Furthermore the
                          implementation is supposed to be reasonable efficient
                          (in comparison to peano numbers). This implementation
                          is inspired by a similar approach in the functional
                          logic programming language Curry.
