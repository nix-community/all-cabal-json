Description:            Implementation of natural numbers and integers by a binary
                                representation. All functions are supposed to be as non-strict as
                                possible. Furthermore the implementation is supposed to be 
                                reasonable efficient (in comparison to peano numbers). This
                                implementation is inspired by a similar approach in the functional
                                logic programming language Curry.
