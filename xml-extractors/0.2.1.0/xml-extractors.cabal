name:                xml-extractors
version:             0.2.1.0
synopsis:            Simple wrapper over xml to extract data from parsed xml
description:
  This is a library to simplify extraction of data from parsed xml.
  .
  See the 'Text.XML.Light.Extractors' module for an example.
  .
  = Motivation
  .
  The `xml` package provides functions to parse and get information from
  xml data. It will parse an xml string into a generic tree
  representation. Extracting information from such a tree while
  keeping track of location to handle errors is tricky. This library
  helps with that.
  .
  If there is an error during extraction (expected information is
  absent or wrong), it will return an error value with position information.
  .
  = Some limitations
  .
    * Only handles unqualified names.
  .
    * No column number and sometimes no line number reference in error values.
