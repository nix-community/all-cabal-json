synopsis:     Monad transformer library with type indexes, 
	      providing 'free' copies.
description:
    A monad transformer library with type indexes, which allows the
    programmer to get a distinct copy of one of the monads without
    reproducing definitions and instances.  It doesn't currently
    support Error or List monads.  Inspired by the original mtl.  That
    library was inspired by the paper /Functional Programming with
    Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones
    (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>), Advanced
    School of Functional Programming, 1995.
