synopsis:     Monad transformer library with type indexes, 
	      providing 'free' copies.
description:
    A monad transformer library with type indexes, which allows the
    programmer to get a distinct copy of one of the monads without
    reproducing definitions and instances.  It currently
    supports IdentityX, ReaderX, StateX, WriterX, RWSX, and ErrorX
    monads (and their transformer versions).  All these copies can be
    combined into a transformer stack, including any of the original
    mtl monads. Inspired by the original mtl.  That library was
    inspired by the paper /Functional Programming with Overloading and
    Higher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones
    (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>), Advanced
    School of Functional Programming, 1995.  See the Examples.hs file
    for usage.
