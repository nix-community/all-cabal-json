synopsis:            Haskell bindings to libconfig
description:
            Low-level FFI bindings to the <http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/ libconfig>
            configuration file library.
            .
            This binding is very low-level at the moment, but higher-level safe
            interfaces are planned.
            .

            This library only binds to version 1.4.9 of the libconfig
            library, which is known as @libconfig9@ in Debian-like
            distributions, including Ubuntu.  It will not work with
            older versions of libconfig, including the @libconfig8@
            distributed in Ubuntu 12.04.
