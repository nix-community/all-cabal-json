Synopsis:       A super small web framework for those who don't like big and fancy codebases
Description:
    Ketchup is a very small HTTP server implementation, currently 300 LoC (for the whole thing)!
    .
    Ketchup is also made to be as modular and embeddable as possible, if you want a cabal-free Haskell app, just take those two/three files you need and put it in your project!
    .
    Currently Ketchup comes with:
    .
    * Basic httpd functionality (IPV4 only for now)
    .
    * URL Routing with parameters (ie. \/user\/:name\/)
    .
    * Static file handler (ie. static \".\" as route/handler)
    .
    * Basic Auth (please use it over a HTTPS reverse proxy)
    .
    Dependencies
    .
    The core parts of Ketchup are all depedency free, that includes Ketchup.Httpd and Ketchup.Utils (and to a certain extent, Ketchup.Chunked).
    The dependencies required are for the following modules:
    .
    * Ketchup.Static (uses mime-types)
    .
    * Ketchup.Auth (uses base64-bytestring)
    .
