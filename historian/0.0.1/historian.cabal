Name:           historian
Version:        0.0.1
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.2
Synopsis:       Extract the interesting bits from shell history
Description:    Extract interesting commands and add them to a text file.
                \"Interesting\" means not matching any regular expression in the
                file. This allows one to keep a textual database of commands.

                Never again say \"I wish I remembered what arguments to give
                wibble to make it flibber the gibbet\" three months after you
                looked it up.
                
                WARNING: historian truncates ~/.bash_history.
