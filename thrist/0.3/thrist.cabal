Name:                thrist
Version:             0.3
Synopsis:            Type-threaded list

Description:
    @Thrist@ is a list-like data structure (GADT)
    whose elements are values of a two-parameter
    datatype. The typing constraint ensures that
    the second type parameter of a former value
    unifies with the first type parameter of the
    latter.
    .
    This threading of types is the foundation for
    thrists' nice properties. E.g., paired with a
    suitable semantics, function composition (.)
    can be embedded.
    .
    Sub-modules demonstrate the power of the thrist
    idea by emulating some familiar data structures.
    .

    (draft) paper \"Thrists: Dominoes of Data\" at
