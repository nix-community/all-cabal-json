synopsis:            HaskRel, Haskell as a DBMS with support for the relational
                     algebra

description:
  HaskRel aims to define those elements of the relational theory of database
  management that Haskell can accommodate, thus enabling Haskell (or more
  precisely GHC) in its own right as a DBMS with first-class support for those
  parts of the relational model. It does not qualify as a proper RDBMS since it
  as-is only defines the relational algebra, relational variables and relational
  assignment. It does not define the relational calculus, views, constraints and
  transactions (beyond the fundamental requirement that the tuples of relations
  are to be unique), certain operators like relation valued aggregate operators,
  nor a few minor or even deprecated operators such as DIVIDE. The implemented
  parts are decently complete even if there are major implementation
  shortcomings that prevent this from being practically usable as an actual
  DBMS.
  .
  I refer to it as "/first-class/" since the types of the relational model are
  first-class types to Haskell, and the Haskell type system is able to induce
  the type resulting of relational expressions (for instance that a natural join
  of two relations results in a relation with a heading that is the setwise
  union of the headings of the original relations).
  .
  == The HaskRel library
  .
  Not all modules of this library are relevant to gain an understanding of how
  it functions, the next part to go to at this point is
  "Database.HaskRel.RDBMS", and the modules it reexports. See also README.md.
