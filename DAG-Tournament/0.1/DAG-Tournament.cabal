synopsis:           Real-Time Game Tournament Evaluator
description:
    DAG-Tournament, where DAG stands for directed acyclic graph, is a graphical
    program to manage an informal tournament of games such as foosball. It is
    designed for open-for-all tournaments without schedule, for example to
    record all games as they happen in the free time program of a serious
    event, such as a conference.
    .
    Games can be entered as they happen. The program does not generate a
    complete ranking, but only visualizes what it knows about who is better
    than who based on direct comparison, or a path of direct comparisons.
    Cycles are broken at the edge of least significance. The visualisation is
    baesd on springs and forces and updated in real time, already producing
    entertaining effects.
    .
    DAG-Tournaments supports more than one tournament at the same time, e.g.
    foosball and pool billard, and can switch between the two rankings with one
    keypress, again showing an entaining shuffling of nodes until a stable
    state is reached again.
