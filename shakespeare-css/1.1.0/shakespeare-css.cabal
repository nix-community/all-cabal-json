description:
    .
    Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with simple variable interpolation. Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates variables according to the type being inserted.
    In this case, the variable type needs a ToCss instance.
    .
    This package contains 2 css template languages. The Cassius language uses whitespace to avoid the need for closing brackets and semi-colons. Lucius does not care about whitespace and is a strict superset of css. There are also some significant conveniences added for css.
