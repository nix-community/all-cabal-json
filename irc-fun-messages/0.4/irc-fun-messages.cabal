name:                irc-fun-messages
version:             0.4
synopsis:            Types and functions for working with the IRC protocol.
description:
  Another IRC library. It doesn't provide a client API though. It just provides
  functions for parsing and serializing IRC commands and replies.
  .
  The package is based on RFC 2812, with modifications and extensions to work
  with Freenode.
  .
  NOTE: The handling of IRC protocol messages is incomplete, but there
  is enough to e.g. create an IRC bot. Missing features are being added as
  needed while working on <https://notabug.org/fr33domlover/funbot FunBot>, and
  of course patches are welcome.
