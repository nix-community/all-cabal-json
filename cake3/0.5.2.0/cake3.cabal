description: 
    Cake3 is a EDSL for building Makefiles, written in Haskell. With cake3,
    developer can write their build logic in Haskell, obtain clean and safe Makefile
    and distribute it among the non-Haskell-aware users. Currenly, GNU Make is
    the only backend supported.
    .
    /Example program/
    .
    > module Cakefile where
    >
    > import Development.Cake3
    > import Cakefile_P
    >
    > cs = map file ["main.c", "second.c"]
    >
    > main = writeMake (file "Makefile") $ do
    >   selfUpdate
    >   d <- rule $ do
    >     shell [cmd|gcc -M $cs -MF @(file "depend.mk")|]
    >   os <- forM cs $ \c -> do
    >     rule $ do
    >       shell [cmd| gcc -c $(extvar "CFLAGS") -o @(c.="o") $c |]
    >   elf <- rule $ do
    >     shell [cmd| gcc -o @(file "main.elf") $os |]
    >   rule $ do
    >     phony "all"
    >     depend elf
    >   includeMakefile d

    /Basic workflow/
    .
      * Install the cake3
    .
      * Create Cakefile.hs in the project root
    .
      * Build the application using cake3 script provided
    . 
      * Execute the application to obtain the Makefile
    .
    See the README on the GitHub <https://github.com/grwlf/cake3> for more
    information. Distribution contains several example projects.
