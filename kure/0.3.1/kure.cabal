Version:             0.3.1
Synopsis:            Combinators for Strategic Programming
Description:	     KURE is a DSL for building rewriting DSLs.
	 	     KURE shares combinator names and concepts with Stratego, but unlike Stratego, KURE is strongly typed.
		     KURE is similar to Strafunski, but has a lightweight generic traversal mechanism using type families
		     rather than SYB,
		     and the KURE combinators are parameterized to provide the ability to have context sensitive rewrites.
