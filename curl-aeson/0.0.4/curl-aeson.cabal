synopsis:      Communicate with HTTP service using JSON 
description:   A library for communicating with JSON over HTTP connection.
	       Supports rich set of HTTP connectivity features provided by
	       libcurl combined to the performance and elegancy of aeson.
	       .
	       All HTTP methods are supported. Instances of 'ToJSON' and
	       'FromJSON' typeclasses can be transferred via this library.
	       Session cookies and other HTTP options may be passed to libcurl
	       if needed.
	       .
	       This library is at its best when communicating with simple,
	       non-standardized JSON interfaces. If you are implementing
	       JSON-RPC compliant client or server, take a look at
	       <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jmacro-rpc>.
