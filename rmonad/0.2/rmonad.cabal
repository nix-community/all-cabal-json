description:
        A library for restricted monads based on associated datatypes.
        This allows datatypes such as Set to be made into monads.
        Users can either use the NoImplicitPrelude extension and use
        Control.RMonad directly, or use Control.RMonad.AsMonad with
        the embed and unEmbed combinators to use the normal Prelude
        monad operations.
exposed-modules:
        Control.RMonad
        Control.RMonad.AsMonad
