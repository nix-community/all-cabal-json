version:              0.1.0.0
synopsis:             Make a MonoFoldable type into an ordinary Foldable type.
description:
  For a container to be  "Foldable", it must be able to accept all types. This means that ByteStrings and unboxed arrays/vectors
  are not foldable, as they have restrictions on their elements. This wrapper makes them Foldable.
