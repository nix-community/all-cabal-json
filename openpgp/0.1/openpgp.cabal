description:     This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP-PHP <http://github.com/bendiken/openpgp-php>.
        It defines types Message and Packet to represent OpenPGP messages as series
        of packets and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate
        encoding/decoding.
        .
        There is also a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>
        that currently does fingerprint generation and signature verification.
        .
        It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.  If importing both modules, something like this will do:
        .
        > import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
        > import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
