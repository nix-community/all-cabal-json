Name:                ImperativeHaskell
Version:             0.2.0.0
Description:         A monad that uses GADTs and continuations
                     to replicate what it is like to program
                     in an imperative language like C or Java
                     with "return", "for", "break", "continue", 
                     and mutable references.
Synopsis:	     A library for writing Imperative style haskell.
