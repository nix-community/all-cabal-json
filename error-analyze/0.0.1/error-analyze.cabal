description:
    Parse ghc and cabal error messages and give their causes for easier resolution.
    .
    Just pass the error message to 'errorCauses' and get a list of possible explanations/resolutions ('ErrorCause')
    .
    Check the test suite for examples.
    .
    This functionality was originally developed in Java as part of EclipseFP but was rewritten
    in Haskell in the hope it can be useful to other IDE tools or GHC library wrappers.
