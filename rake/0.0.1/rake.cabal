Description:
  
  Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
  is an algorithm to automatically extract keywords from documents.
  Keywords are sequences of one or more words that, together,
  provide a compact representation of content (see reference below).
  RAKE is a well-known and widely used NLP technique,
  but its concrete application depends a lot on factors like
  the language in which the content is written, 
  the domain of the content and
  the purpose of the keywords.
  
  .

  The implementation in this library is mainly aimed at English. 
  With additional resources, it is also applicable to other language.
  The library is inspired by a similar implementation in Python 
  (<https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE>).

  .

  The algorithm is described, for instance, in:
  Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010): 
  Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individual Documents.
