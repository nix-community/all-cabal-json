Name:                   bindings-sc3
Version:                0.4.1
Synopsis:               Low-level bindings to the SuperCollider synthesis engine library.
Description:
    DEPRECATED. This library is looking for a new maintainer.
    .
    This library provides low level bindings to the SuperCollider synthesis
    engine library (@libscsynth@). If you are looking for a higher level
    Haskell interface, please use the /hsc3-process/ package
    (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsc3-process>).
    .
    ChangeLog: <https://github.com/kaoskorobase/bindings-sc3/blob/master/ChangeLog.md>
    .
    In order to use this package, you need to build the dynamic library version
    of SuperCollider <supercollider.sourceforge.net> by passing
    @-DLIBSCSYNTH=ON@ to @cmake@ and put it in a location where it can be found by the
    linker (e.g. @/usr/local/lib@ on Unix systems, alternatively use the @--extra-lib-dirs@
    flag of @cabal configure@).
    .
    The required SuperCollider version is 3.5.
