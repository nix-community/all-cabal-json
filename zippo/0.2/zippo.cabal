-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A simple lens-based, generic, heterogenous, type-checked zipper library

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         This light-weight library provides a basic, but fully-type-checked 
                     zipper implementation, suitable for any algebraic data structure.
                     Our implementation has no notion of \"left\" and \"right\", and 
                     instead uses lenses (from the "yall" package) to indicate directions
                     to \"navigate down to\".
                     .
                     For a similar approach with many more features, but less type-safety
                     see "pez".
