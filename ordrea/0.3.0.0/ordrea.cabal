name:                ordrea
version:             0.3.0.0
synopsis:            Push-pull implementation of discrete-time FRP
description:         This is an FRP library with the following characteristics:
                     .
                     * classical: it has first-class signals
                     .
                     * synchronous: it has a clear notion of simultaneous events
                     .
                     * higher-order: signals inside signals can be flattened
                     to get a switching behavior
                     .
                     * push-based: inactive events has zero runtime costs
                     .
                     This package is in the alpha stage.
