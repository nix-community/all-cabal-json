synopsis:
  Writing helper for those with Stephen Hawking like impairment.
description:
  This is a proof-of-concept application for exercising writing
  using binary choices, i.e., selecting from two sets of
  consecutive letters. This is tiresome, but for those suffering
  from motor neuron diseases (specially one like amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis, where cognitive functions remain intact) even
  this small program can already be used to comunicate with the
  help of an assistant.
