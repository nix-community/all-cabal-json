Name:                repa-devil
Version:             0.3.1
Synopsis:            Support for image reading and writing of Repa arrays using in-place FFI calls

Description:         The repa-image library adds support for reading and
                     writing images in many formats based on the DevIL
                     open source image library. Image data is represented in Haskell
                     as typed, multi-dimensional repa arrays.
                     .
                     Developer\'s Image Library (DevIL) is a library to
                     develop applications with very powerful image
                     loading capabilities, yet with a relatively simple
                     interface. DevIL can load, save, convert,
                     manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of
                     image formats, including:
                     . 
                     * BMP, ICO, JPG, PNG, PNM, TGA, TIF, GIF, EXIF and many more.
                     .
