Name:                planar-graph
Version:             1.0.0.0
Synopsis:            A representation of planar graphs
Description:         {
Planar graphs are graphs that can be embedded onto a surface
(i.e. they can be drawn on that surface without any edges crossing).
As such, it is preferable to use a dedicated data structure for them
that has information about how to achieve this embedding rather than a
standard graph data structure.
.
(Please note however that this implementation has only been tested in
terms of the embedding being on the unit sphere or disc; whether it
works or not as-is on any other type of surface is unknown.)
