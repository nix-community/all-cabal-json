Name: PriorityChansConverger
Synopsis: 
        Read single output from an array of inputs - channels with priorities
Description: 
        Abbreviation for the @PriorityChansConverger@ is PCC.
        .
        Based on @STM.TChan@, extended with capacity control. 
        Wrapped into IO version is also available. 
        .
        When user reads from the PCC, the choice is made - from which channel 
        to read. System selects a nonempty channel, whose (CurrentPriority, 
        StartPriority) tuple is max. The side effect of the channel selection 
        is it's /CurrentPriority/ decrease by one, if it's value becomes 
        less than one, then the /CurrentPriority/ is set to /StartPriority/.
        .
        For the main API interface:
        .
        @import Control.Concurrent.PriorityChansConverger@
        .
        The realization probably isn't 
        very fast and isn't good at memory economy, since it uses fresh high 
        level primitive - STM. It wasn't intended to be used 
        with millions of channels. But it's max throughput comparing to the 
        ordinary @Chan@ throughput is to be estimated (will do it in some 
        future version).
