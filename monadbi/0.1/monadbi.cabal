Name:                monadbi
Version:             0.1
Description:         This module provides a Class called @MonadBi@ which acts as a superset
                     of @MonadTrans@, and provides @raise@ analogous to @lift@,
                     i.e. lifts underlying monads into the transformer. It also provides
                     @lower@ which is the opposite of @lift@, and extracts underlying monads from monad transformers.

                     Generally speaking, MonadBi represents the relationship between monads that can be transformed into each other (atleast partially).

                     Natural instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.

Synopsis:            Extract underlying monads from monad transformers
