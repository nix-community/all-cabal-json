-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis: Package for handling icon fonts in Haskell

-- A longer description of the package.
description: This package is intended to provide access to a variety of icon fonts.  Everything is mostly a port of the all-the-icons package for emacs.  The largest difference is that the type system is used to ensure that the user doesn't need to worry about which font produces which icon.
