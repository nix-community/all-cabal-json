                     in ~1000 lines of haskell.
                     this is at the moment exceptionally ALPHA level software.
                     no tests for the validity of the type checker (only the
                     type synthesizer), or the parser, or the repl, etc...
                     there are dragons in here (soon to be tamed), and lots
                     of them!

                     todo: profiling, unit testing, formal verification of type correctness
                           adequacy proof of the implemented type system.
