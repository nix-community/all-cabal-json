synopsis:            Haskell programming interface to Yices SMT solver
description:         Incomplete (no bitvectors) syntax, parser, and inter
                     process communication to Yices from Haskell through pipe.
                     Purpose for building and using this library was to generate
                     test cases from constraints that SMT solvers can solve.  I
                     only used it for that particular purpose, so the code in
                     general is not yet fully tested.  Use at your own risk and
                     error reports are welcomed. See <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>
