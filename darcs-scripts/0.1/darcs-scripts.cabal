Synopsis:            Shell scripts for support of darcs workflow
Description:
  This is a collection of Bash shell scripts
  for support of development using the revision control system Darcs.
  The scripts are installed in your @cabal/share@ directory,
  thus you may extend your command search path accordingly.
  .
  Within a Darcs working copy you may run:
  .
  * @editor \`darcs-list-modified\`@:
    Open an editor with all files that are modified
    with respect to the current local repository state.
  .
  * @darcs-replace-rec OLD NEW dirOrFileA dirOrFileB@:
    Replace @OLD@ by @NEW@ in all files in @dirOrFileA@ and so on,
    that contain @OLD@.
    This calls @darcs replace@, that is,
    the replacements are managed by Darcs as such.
  .
  * @darcs-mv-hs src\/Data\/Special.hs src\/Control\/Extra.hs@:
    Move the file @src\/Data\/Special.hs@ to @src\/Control\/Extra.hs@
    and replace the according module name
    @Data.Special@ by @Control.Extra@
    in all modules in directory @src@ and in the cabal file.
    The first component must be a directory for source files.
    If you do not have a source directory, you may use @.@,
    but then files in @_darcs@ are also addressed,
    and Darcs will warn you.
    Nested source directories are not supported.
  .
  * @darcs-conv-latin-to-utf8 dirOrFile ...@:
    Convert all files from Latin encoding to UTF8 encoding.
    You may easily adapt the script in order
    to convert between other encodings.
    Instead of using non-ASCII encodings
    you may replace non-ASCII symbols by Haskell string escape codes.
  .
  * @darcs-replace-finitemap@:
    Convert old programs from use of @FiniteMap@ to @containers:Data.Map@.
  .
  * @darcs-mv-m3@ and @darcs-mv-mg@ are for Modula-3 development.
    They rename both interface and implementation file of a module
    and replace module names accordingly.
