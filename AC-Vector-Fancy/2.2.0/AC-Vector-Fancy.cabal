Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Name:          AC-Vector-Fancy
Version:       2.2.0
Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Fancy type-system stuff for AC-Vector

Description:

  Adds various type-system tricks to AC-Vector.
  (Requires several language extensions, including
  type families.)

  Names updated to match AC-Vector. Gather modules are now
  here instead of in AC-Vector, and some module names have
  changed too for greater consistency. Added a new HasSpace
  class for generically dealing with structures of
  different dimensionallities (and updated everything else
  to use it).
