Synopsis:      Fancy type-system stuff for AC-Vector

Description:

  Adds various type-system tricks to AC-Vector.
  (Requires several language extensions, including
  type families.)

  Changed the @Project@ class from being multi-parameter
  to using an associated type. (Should help resolve some
  of the \"ambiguous type\" errors.)
