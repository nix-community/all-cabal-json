Name:          AC-Vector-Fancy
Version:       2.4.0
Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Fancy type-system stuff for AC-Vector

Description:

  Adds various type-system tricks to AC-Vector.
  (Requires several language extensions, including
  type families.)

  Added missing @Vector Point@ constraint to @HasSpace@
  class. Consequently removed @HasSpace Range@ instance.
  Added @unions@ method to @BoundingBox@ class. Added
  @axis_range@ function.
