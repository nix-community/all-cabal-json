synopsis:
  Low level bindings for foreign libraries
  following community driven guidelines
description: 
  This package aims at beeing a wide collection of low-level bindings
  covering as much as possible of the functionality of good quality
  libraries, following a common set of community driven guidelines.
  (The current set of guidelines is shown at "Bindings" module
  documentation.) It has been created as an attempt to relieve the
  common situation where developers of high-level modules can't waste
  effort with all details of low-level work, and for those writing
  compreensive and reliable low-level bindings little time is left to
  get the best of Haskell. Developers with good understanding of their
  favorite foreign language libraries and Haskell FFI can benefict
  from contributing to this package by sharing guidelines, tests and
  code facilities, and help each other in issues of reliability and
  portability; and developers of higher-level modules can put their
  efforts where they are needed, with a reliable set of low-level code
  at hand.
