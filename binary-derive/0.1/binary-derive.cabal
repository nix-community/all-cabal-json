Synopsis: Automatic deriving of Binary using GHC.Generics
Description: This package provides deriveGet and derivePut, respectively, which
    each can be used to quickly create an instance of Binary for any time which
    implements Generic. Naturally, this can be used with -XDeriveGeneric to not     have to write any boilerplate code. This differs from binary-generic which
    relies on the Data class instead and doesn't seem to have quite the same
    implementation philosophy. Once Ghc 7.2 is stable, this could be combined
    into the binary package to provide a sensible default for the Binary class.
