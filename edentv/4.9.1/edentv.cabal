synopsis:            A Tool to Visualize Parallel Functional Program Executions
description:         The Eden Trace Viewer is a tool designed to help
                     programmers optimize Eden programs by visualising traces
                     (eventlog files) of Eden program runs. It is similar to
                     (and precedes) threadscope. However, it has been designed
                     to visualize not just threads, but also different
                     machines, processes, and messages between processes.
                     EdenTV can show you what has happened during the
                     execution of your program. This is very helpful to
                     optimize parallel programs.
