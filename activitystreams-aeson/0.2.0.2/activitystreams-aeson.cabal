synopsis:            An interface to the ActivityStreams specification
description:         An interface to the
                     <http://activitystrea.ms/ Activity Streams>
                     specifications, using an @aeson@-based representation
                     of the underlying ActivityStream structures.

                     An ActivityStream is a representation of social
                     activities in JSON format, using a standard set of
                     structures. The specification is very flexible in
                     allowing most fields to be omitted, while also
                     allowing arbitrary new fields to be created when
                     necessary. This library attempts to maximize
                     type safety while retaining the flexibility present
                     in the specification.
