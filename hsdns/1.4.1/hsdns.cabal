-- Building these executables doesn't work anymore with the latest
-- cabal version. The problem is that the file ADNS/Base.hs is no
-- longer generated into the source tree, but into the dist/
-- directory, where the example programs won't find it during
-- compilation.
--
-- To remedy the situation, we need either a really wild search
-- path so that ADNS/Base.hs is found in the build dir, or we need
-- separate cabal files for building the library and the example
-- programs (which would suck) or some other magic way I am
-- currently unaware of but that probably exists. Whatever.
