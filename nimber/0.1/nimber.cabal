Name:               nimber
Version:            0.1
Synopsis:           An implementation of (finite) nimbers
Description:        This library provides a method to do arithmetic on
		            nimbers, which may be considered an alternative field
			        over the non-negative integers (the general case of
			        transfinite ordinal nimbers is not implementented.)
                    Note that division is extremely slow at this point,
                    due to the lack of a closed-form implementation.
