-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Delta is a library for detecting file changes in any given
                     directory. The package is written using the sodium FRP library
                     but it also provides a callback based API.
                     .
                     File changes on OS X are based on the @FSEvents@ API that is also
                     used by TimeMachine. On other operating systems the library
                     currently uses recursive descents in directories. I will include
                     @inotify@ for Linux. If someone would like to have a non-polling
                     based API for windows or BSD, I would really like it if anyone
                     would contribute.
                     .
                     The project also contains an executable, delta-run, which
                     allows you to run arbitrary shell commands when a file in a
                     directory (recursively) changes. 
                     .
                     @
                     $> delta-run --help
                     Usage: delta-run [-i|--interval INTERVAL] [-v|--verbose] FILE CMD

                     Available options:
			    -h,--help                Show this help text
			    -i,--interval INTERVAL   Run at most every n seconds
			    -v,--verbose             Print extra output
			    FILE                     The directory that is watched
                            CMD                      The command to run

                     @
                     .
                     For example you could use @delta-run@ to rebuild your project
                     everytime the source changes like this:
                     .
                     @
                     delta-run ./src \"cabal build\"
                     @
