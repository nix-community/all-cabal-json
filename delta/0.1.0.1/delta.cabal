-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            A library for detecting file changes

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Delta is a library for detecting file changes in any given
                     directory. The package is written using the sodium FRP library
                     but it also provides a callback based API.

                     The project also contains an executable, delta-cli which
                     runs on the command line and prints detected changes to stdout.
