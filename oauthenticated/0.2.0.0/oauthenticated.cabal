name:           oauthenticated
version:        0.2.0.0
synopsis:       Simple OAuth for http-client
description:    /Warning/: This software is pre 1.0 and thus its API may change very
                dynamically while updating only minor versions. This package will follow the
                PVP once it reaches version 1.0.
                .
                OAuth is a popular protocol allowing servers to offer resources owned by some
                user to a series of authorized clients securely. For instance, OAuth lets
                Twitter provide access to a user's private tweets to the Twitter client
                registered on their phone.
                .
                @oauthenticated@ is a Haskell library implementing OAuth protocols atop the
                minimalistic @http-client@ HTTP client library extracted from @http-conduit@.
                "Network.OAuth" offers simple functions for signing
                'Network.HTTP.Client.Request's along with tools for 'Network.OAuth.Cred'ential
                management and 'Network.OAuth.Server' configuration. "Network.OAuth.Simple"
                provides a slightly more heavy-weight interface which manages the necessary state
                and configuration using a monad transformer stack.
                .
                There's also an implementation of OAuth's three-legged credential acquisition
                protocol built atop the "Network.OAuth" API. This can be handled in both
                conformant and old-style modes: conformant will reject server responses which
                are not conformant with RFC 5849 (which builds atop community version OAuth
                1.0a) while old-style better allows for less-than-compliant servers. See
                'Network.OAuth.Types.Params.Version' for more details.
                .
                Currently @oauthenticated@ only supports OAuth 1.0 and is in alpha. OAuth 2.0
                support is a potential goal, but it's unclear if it can be transparently
                supported at a similar level of abstraction.
