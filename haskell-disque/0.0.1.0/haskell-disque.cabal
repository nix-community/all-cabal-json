synopsis:            Client library for the Disque datastore
description:         Disque is an ongoing experiment to build a distributed, in-memory, message broker.Its goal is to capture the essence of the "Redis as a jobs queue" use case, which is usually implemented using blocking list operations, and move it into an ad-hoc, self-contained, scalable, and fault tolerant design, with simple to understand properties and guarantees, but still resembling Redis in terms of simplicity, performance, and implementation as a C non-blocking networked server. This library is a Haskell client for the Disque datastore.
