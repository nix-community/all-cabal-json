synopsis:        Transactional events, based on Concurrent ML semantics
description:     A quick-and-dirty implementation of transactional events.
                 Matthew Fluet's version
                 ("http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~fluet/research/tx-events/")
                 is probably a better implmentation, but this is an
                 interesting start for a technique to experiment with.
