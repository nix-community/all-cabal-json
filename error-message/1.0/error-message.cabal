Synopsis:       Composable error messages.
Build-Type:     Simple
Description:
    This philosophy behind this package is that it is often better to find
    out all of the errors that have occured in a computation and report them
    simultaneously, rather than aborting as soon as the first error is
    encountered.  Towards this end, this module supplies a type of
    /combinable error messages/ so that all of the errors from subcomputations
    can be gathered and presented together.
