synopsis:            Wrapper daemon to manage an ssh tunnel
description:         This is a daemon that executes an ssh command to form a secure tunnel and then blocks on it. If the tunnel goes down, sshtun can attempt to reestablish it. It can also be set up to monitor a file on an http server to determine if the tunnel should be up or not, so you can switch it on or off remotely.
