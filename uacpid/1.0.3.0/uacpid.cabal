synopsis:            Userspace Advanced Configuration and Power Interface 
                     event daemon
description:         uacpid is a daemon designed to be run in userspace 
                     that will monitor the local system's acpid socket 
                     for hardware events. These events can then be acted 
                     upon by handlers with access to the user's
                     environment.
