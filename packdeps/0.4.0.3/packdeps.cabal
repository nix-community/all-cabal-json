synopsis:        Check your cabal packages for lagging dependencies.
description:
    This provides a library and command line tool for checking if the upper bounds in your package's dependency list excludes the newest package available. The code was originally available only as a web interface at <http://packdeps.haskellers.com/>, but is now available for standalone use as well.
    .
    The command line tool has an incredibly simple interface: simply pass it a list of cabal files, and it will tell you what dependencies- if any- are restricted.
