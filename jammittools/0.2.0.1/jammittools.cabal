Version:            0.2.0.1
Synopsis:           Export sheet music and audio from Windows/Mac app Jammit
Description:        <http://www.jammit.com/ Jammit> is a service and associated
                    app for Windows\/Mac\/iOS that sells isolated instrument
                    audio tracks from popular music, along with full
                    transcriptions. This is a tool that allows you to export the
                    sheet music (in PDF format) and audio (in WAV format) to
                    tracks that you have purchased.
                    .
                    Any sheet music or audio you export is solely for your own
                    use, e.g. for use on Linux and Android devices that do not
                    have the official app available. Please do not use this tool
                    to share content with others who have not purchased it!
                    .
                    You must install ImageMagick and Sox for sheet music and
                    audio export respectively, because they are used to do the
                    actual conversion.
                    Please see the
