Description:         Bindings to Miniball, a C++ library (<http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>) for
                     computing the smallest enclosing ball of a set of points in Euclidean space.
                     .
                     The Miniball library itself is not included, as I consider it a dependency. It consists of only
                     a header file, and can be retrieved from <http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>.
                     To build this package, simply have @miniball.hpp@ in GCC's include path. The standard C++ library
                     and GCC with C++ support are also needed.
                     .
                     Hackage probably fails to build the Haddock documentation since Miniball itself is missing. The
                     documentation can be viewed at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-miniball/>.

                     Miniball itself is copyright 1999-2013, Bernd Gärtner.
                     .
                     The current version has only been tested with version 3.0 of Miniball.
                     .
                     Changes in version 0.1.0.2:
                     .
                     * Improve allocation before FFI call. Good speedup for short calls (factor 3 for 100000 points in R^3).
