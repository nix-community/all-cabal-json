Synopsis:       preprocessor translating arrow notation into Haskell 98
Description:    A preprocessor that reads Haskell with arrow notation
                and outputs Haskell 98.  Note that GHC 6.2 or later has
                built-in support for arrow notation, so if you're only
                using GHC, you don't need this preprocessor: just rename
                your arrow module as an ordinary Haskell source file and
                invoke GHC with the -farrows option.  You'll get better
                error messages for arrow code, too.
