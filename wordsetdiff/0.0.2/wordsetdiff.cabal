Synopsis: Compare two files as sets of words or sets of N-tuples of words.

Description: This utility is useful for finding out if some old,
             misplaced version of a file (say from your old laptop)
             has any new text in it that never got checked in, synced,
             or copied over to your newest version of the file.

	     The basic unix diff tool is sometimes incredibly
	     unsatisfactory for this purpose, for example when text has
	     been moved around, or when there are widespread whitespace
	     differences.
