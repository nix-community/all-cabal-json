Synopsis:       Vector clocks for versioning message flows
Build-Type:     Simple
Description:
        This package provides a ready to use implementation of the
        vector clock data-structures, which may be used to version
        messages and determine causality relations between them in
        a distributed system.
        .
        See /Fundamentals of Distributed Computing: A Practical Tour
        of Vector Clock Systems/ by R. Baldoni and M. Raynal for an
        overview of vector clocks.
        .
        See the README.md file for details.
