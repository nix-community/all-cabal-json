description:

    This library defines a set of functions that convert between
    the "Pipes" and "Data.Enumerator" paradigms. The conversion
    is bidirectional: an appropriately-typed pipe can be converted
    into an 'E.Iteratee' and back into a pipe. In addition, a pipe
    can be fed into an iteratee (or, more specifically, 'E.Step'),
    resulting in an 'E.Enumerator'.

    The library has been designed specifically for use with "Snap",
    but I'm sure that many other interesting uses of it exist.
