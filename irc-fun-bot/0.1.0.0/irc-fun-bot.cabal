name:                irc-fun-bot
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Very simple library for writing fun IRC bots.
description:
  One day an idea came up on the #freepost IRC channel: We didn't need much of
  the serious features IRC bots provide, but we could develop an IRC bot
  collaboratively, for fun and for learning new skills and languages! I also
  thought this is a great chance for people to quickly see their code in real
  use, which is motivating when learning programming, and it's a chance to
  introduce Haskell to the community.
  .
  And so, this library was started. The API is inspired by the @Irc@ package
  and some other IRC client related packages.
