description:
  This module provides data types and parsers for the General Transit Feed
  Specification, described at
  <http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html>.
  .
  GTFS is used by transit agencies to provide schedules, geographic
  information, etc. to Google Maps and other Google applications.  Many data
  sets are available online, often with few restrictions, so the format is
  useful to third-party developers.
