synopsis:         Extract function names from Windows DLLs. 
description:
  Hurdle - (H)askell (U)tilty (R)egarding (DL)l (E)xports.
  .
  Extract function names from Windows DLLs a-la pexports.
  . 
  Hurdle has minimal dependencies: base, containers, and 
  kangaroo (kangaroo just needs base and array).
  .
  Currently Hurdle also has minimal utility - please consider 
  pexports instead as Hurdle doesn't yet print ordinals and 
  fails on DLLs generated by Visual C++ (which puts function
  symbols in the .rdata section - gcc uses the .edata section).
  .
  Hurdle was a Sunday afternoon hack that has taken a good while
  longer...
  .
  .
