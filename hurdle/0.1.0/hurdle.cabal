  Hurdle - (H)askell (U)tilty (R)egarding (DL)l (E)xports.
  .
  Extract function names from Windows DLLs a-la pexports.
  . 
  Hurdle has minimal dependencies: base, array and pretty.
  .
  Currently Hurdle also has minimal utility - please consider 
  pexports instead as Hurdle doesn't yet print ordinals 
  etcetera (Hurdle was a Sunday afternoon hack that took a wee 
  bit longer). But... if anyone has a compelling use case that 
  would benefit the community, I'm willing to look at extending 
  Hurdle.
