Name:                imagefilters
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Image Filters (contrast, brightness, gaussian blur, etc)
Description:         
    This package brings image filters comparable to PHP's imagefilter functions. In the current release,
    these filters may only be used with the GD Haskell extension library, but in the future it may support
    other image management libraries, such as the new JuicyPixels library.
    .
    imagefilters also supplies functionality for creating custom filters by using the 'pixelTransform' function
    for per-pixel transformations, or the 'convolute' function for the application of convolution matrices
