name:                funbot-ext-events
version:             0.2.0.0
synopsis:            Interact with FunBot's external events.
description:
  This is a library providing types and tools for interacting with
  <https://notabug.org/fr33domlover/funbot FunBot>'s external events. The
  code was extracted from FunBot itself, so that independent programs can
  interact with it, e.g. by using its client API.

  Since the provided types change every time an external event type is added or
  modified, many of this library's releases are expected to break
  compatibility.  In most cases you should either use a higher-level library
  such as <https://notabug.org/fr33domlover/funbot-client.git funbot-client>,
  or perhaps create one yourself.
