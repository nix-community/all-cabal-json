synopsis:            Highlight package versions which differ from the latest
                     version on Hackage
description:         This package provides an executable which reads from
                     stdin and outputs the same thing to stdout,
                     except that any lines which look like package
                     identifiers (e.g. foo-0.3.2) are highlighted if
                     the version does not match the latest version on
                     Hackage: red if the version is less than the
                     version on Hackage, or cyan if greater.  In
                     addition, the Hackage version is shown in blue.
                     .
                     In particular, it can be useful to pipe the
                     output of @cabal(-dev) install --dry-run@ through
                     this program, to aid in checking the install
                     plan. It's usually a good idea to understand why
                     an outdated package is being installed; otherwise
                     it can indicate that something needs to be updated.
