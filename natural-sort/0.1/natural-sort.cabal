name: natural-sort
version: 0.1
synopsis: User-friendly text collation
description:
  The built-in comparisons for textual data are based on Unicode ordinals. This
  does not match most every-day sorting algorithms. For example,
  \"z10.txt\" is sorted after \"z2.txt\" by users, but before it by na√Øve
  algorithms.
  .
  This package provides an implementation of \"natural sort\", which more
  closely matches user expectations.
