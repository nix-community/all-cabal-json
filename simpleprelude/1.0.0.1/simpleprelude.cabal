Name:                simpleprelude

Version:             1.0.0.1

Synopsis:            A simplified Haskell prelude for teaching

Description:         simpleprelude provides an alternative Prelude
                     module for teaching as well as wrappers for ghc,
                     and ghci to use them.
                     .
		     The simplified Prelude omits the type classes
                     Num, Integral, and Ord. Instead it provides
                     monomorphically typed arithmetic operators on
                     Integer.
                     .
                     It also provides two executables: simple-ghc and
                     simple-ghci which are wrappers around ghc and
                     ghci. They are pre-configured to use the Prelude
                     module of this library instead of base's Prelude
                     module.
