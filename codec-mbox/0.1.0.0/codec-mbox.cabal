synopsis:        A library to read and write mailboxes in mbox format
description:     The library provides functions to read, write, and
                 manipulate mbox's. This library focuses on three points:
                 robustness, efficency, and scalability. It's using lazy
                 bytestrings and can handle very big mailboxes.
