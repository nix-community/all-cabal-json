Synopsis:           Query language and report generator for edit logs.
Description:        This program can be used to see exactly how much time 
                    you spent working on file X, project Y or language Z. 
                    It can also be used to see for instance what your most 
                    productive time of the year, month or week is. 

                    In the long-run, this might help you make better time 
                    estimates, while also providing you with an overview 
                    of what you have worked on (which can also be nice for CV's).
                    In short; this program allows you to query your logs
                    and generate reports in plain text, html, xhtml and CSV.
                    Support for more output formats is planned for the future.
                    See the github page for more information.
