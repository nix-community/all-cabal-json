Synopsis:         A small command-line accounting tool:
                  hledger + bugs - features? maybe...
Description:      This is a very minimal command-line program to read a
                  plain-text ledger file and display balance information
                  and other reports. I could have used hledger or ledger
                  for this, but I had some things I wanted to do a little
                  differently... so I did.
