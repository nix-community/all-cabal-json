description:
  .
  Tree drawing with /nice/ layout. 
  .
  Draw trees represented by Data.Tree, output SVG or EPS. The 
  output should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical 
  subtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.
  .
  Note - the demos now use font metrics. Font metrics for the 
  \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ files 
  with GhostScript (AFM file version 2.0 for GhostScript 8.63) or 
  available from Adode (AFM file version 4.1). To run the demos 
  properly you will need one of these sets of metrics.

  \*\* WARNING \*\* - the API is unstable and will change.

  Changelog:
  .
  0.11.0 to 0.11.1:
  .
  * Removed unused @InnerSpace@ constriant on functions in 
    @Wumpus.Tree.Draw@.
  .
  0.10.0 to 0.11.0:
  .
  * Changed types of drawing functions so they can be run with 
    glyph metrics (read from file in the IO monad). 
  .
  * Generalized the unit type of the /design/ functions to some 
    numeric @u@ rather than Double.
  .
  * The demo has been duplicated - one version uses GhostScript 
    glyph metrics and the other Adobe glyph metrics, as the 
    metrics are in different formats and need different font 
    loaders from Wumpus-Basic.
  .  
  0.9.0 to 0.10.0:
  .
  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  0.8.0 to 0.9.0:
  .
  * Stopped re-exporting @DrawingContext@ from Wumpus-Basic in 
    the module Wumpus.Tree. Clients must now import 
    @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@ to get the @DrawingContext@ type and 
    the constructor @StandardContext@.
  .
  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
