description:
  .
  Tree drawing with /nice/ layout. 
  .
  Draw trees represented by Data.Tree, output SVG or EPS. The 
  output should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical 
  subtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.
  .
  Note - the demos now use font metrics. Font metrics for the 
  \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ files 
  with GhostScript (AFM file version 2.0 for GhostScript 8.63) or 
  available from Adode (AFM file version 4.1). To run the demos 
  properly you will need one of these sets of metrics.

  Changelog:
  .
  v0.14.0 to v0.15.0
  .
  * Updated to work with latest Wumpus libraries. 
    @ScalingContext@ has been temporarily added from Wumpus-Basic 
    (it was considered obsolete there). At some point the 
    functionality needs re-implementing so it can be removed from 
    Tree.
  .  
  v0.13.0 to v0.14.0:
  .
  * Updated to work with latest Wumpus libraries. 
  .
  v0.12.0 to v0.13.0:
  .
  * Changed the specification of trees so that they are built in a
    monad. The bind operation of the monad allows /anchors/ to be 
    extracted from tree nodes so they can be annotated with 
    supplementary graphics. At the moment this is rather limited 
    as Wumpus-Basic and Wumpus-Drawing do not offer much support 
    for anchors other than the basic type classes.
  .
  * Changed the type of the rendering functions so they produce a 
    TreeDrawing. This type is more suitable for building composite
    pictures than the previous type TreePicture. 
  .
  * Also the rendering functions now take a start point for the 
    root node, again this should be more convenient for drawing 
    composite pictures - see the demo which now draws all the 
    example trees on one page.
  .
  * Internally the tree design is now more flexible - trees can be 
    designed upwards or leftwards rightwards, rather than just 
    downwards; and edge drawing style is lifted out of the 
    rendering to use a supplied combinator. Currently these 
    features are not exposed by the API, the API needs more 
    thought (possibly warranting changes to Wumpus-Basic and 
    Wumpus-Drawing).
  .
  .
  v0.11.1 to v0.12.0:
  .
  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
