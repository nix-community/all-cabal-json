description:
  .
  Tree drawing with /nice/ layout. 
  .
  Draw trees represented by Data.Tree, output SVG or EPS. The 
  output should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical 
  subtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - the API is unstable and will change. 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.8.0 to 0.9.0:
  .
  * Stopped re-exporting @DrawingContext@ from Wumpus-Basic in 
    the module Wumpus.Tree. Clients must now import 
    @Wumpus.Basic.Graphic@ to get the @DrawingContext@ type and 
    the constructor @StandardContext@.
  .
  * Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.
