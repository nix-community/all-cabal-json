Synopsis:      ZeroTH - remove unnecessary TH depdendencies.
Description:   TemplateHaskell is fairly useful for generating new
               Haskell programs. This, however, incur a dependency on
               TH on subsequent uses where none theoretically should exist.
               ZeroTH solves this by scanning a file for top-level TH
               declarations, evaluates them, and then puts the generated
               code back.
