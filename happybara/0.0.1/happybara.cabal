description:
  /About/
  .
  Happybara is an acceptance test framework inspired by the popular Ruby library
  \"Capybara\". A short example of Happybara's expressive DSL:
  .
  >visit "http://happybara-is-awesome.com"
  >within $ xpath "//form[@id='vote-for-happybara']" $ do
  >   fillIn (fillableField "First Name" [ ]) "Bob"
  >   fillIn (fillableField "Last Name"  [ ]) "Smith"
  >
  >   click $ button "Vote!" [ disabled False ]
