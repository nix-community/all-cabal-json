name:                polydata-core
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Core data definitions for the "polydata" package
description:
  This package, with assistance of the package [polydata](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata),
  allows one to pass data, particularly functions, together with a constraint which describes how
  polymorphic that data is. This constraint can then be used in a generic way to produce quite polymorphic functions,
  for example, a "map" function that works on a pair of two different types.
  .
  See [Data.Poly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata-core/docs/Data-Poly.html)
  for a basic tutorial.
  .
  This package is separate from [polydata](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata) to reduce dependencies,
  however if you want to do anything non-trivial you'll probably want to use the constraint manipulation tools in
  [polydata](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polydata). However, if you have your own way of manipulating
  constraints, you could just use this package directly and only.
