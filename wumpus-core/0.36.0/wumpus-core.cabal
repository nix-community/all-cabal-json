synopsis:         Pure Haskell PostScript and SVG generation. 
description:
  .
  Wumpus is a low-level library for generating static 2D vector 
  pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no FFI 
  dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Wumpus makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths 
  themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low-level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added and dropped between 
  releases, it has no stable API.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for @wumpus-core@ are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a 
  priority. 
  .  
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert EPS files generated by Wumpus to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  VERSION 0.36.0 UPGRADE NOTES
  .
  There are two major changes between 0.35.0 and 0.36.0. 
  .
  @PrimElement@ has been removed and the grouping constructor it 
  provided has been moved into the @Primitive@ type. As both 
  types are opaque, definitions in client code will work without 
  change, /but all/ type signatures referencing @PrimElement@ will 
  need to replace @PrimElement@ with @Primitive@.
  .
  Rotations and scalings on Primitives have changed again.
  Primitives are now instances of the affine classes so support - 
  @rotate@, @rotateAbout@, @scale@, @translate@. Primitives are 
  now considered to be in the implicit affine frame with origin at 
  (0,0). Previously rotatation on Primitives (via the function 
  @rotatePrim@) was really a special case to allow slanted text, 
  the rotation was about the text\'s baseline origin and not the 
  affine frame. As rotation now works differently there is a 
  special constructor for slanted text @rtextlabel@.
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.35.0 to 0.36.0:
  .
  * API / behaviour change - rotation on primitives changed. New 
    functions have been added to create rotated text labels and 
    ellipses (@rtextlabel@, @rstrokeEllipse@, etc.), and 
    Primitives have been made instances of the Affine classes
    except for the general matrix Transform class. The old
    functions for transforming Primitives (@rotatePrim@, 
    @scalePrim@, etc.) have been removed. The demos (Rotated.hs,
    Scaled.hs, Translated.hs) have been removed as they pertain 
    to the old behaviour, there are new demos highlighting the
    new behaviour (TransformEllipse.hs, etc.).
  .
  * Major change - removed the PrimElement type. The (opaque) 
    Primitive type has been changed to incorporate a grouping 
    constructor equivalent to PrimElement\'s @XLinkGroup@ 
    contructor. The change has made the implementation of SVG 
    hyperlinks more efficient, but has forced various type 
    signatures to change in @Core.Picture@. Client code will 
    also have to change type signatures - @PrimElement@ becomes
    @Primitive@.
  .
  * @Core.PtSize@ - the class @FromPtSize@ has been given a @Num@
    superclass constraint. This can shorten type signatures of 
    functions that use @fromPtSize@.
  .
  * Corrected a bug where textlabels would generate an invalid
    bounding box and cause a runtime error when supplied with an
    empty string. Now there is no runtime error - and /no-ops/ 
    are generated in the output.
  .
  * Internal changes - moved @PrimCTM@ from @Core.PictureInternal@
    into separate module. Moved /utility/ modules into their own 
    directory @Utils@. Move /text/ modules into their own 
    directory @Text@. 
  .
  * Removed dependency on @algebra@ for @Semigroup@. The 
    equivalent @append@ operation on @BoundingBox@ is 
    @boundaryUnion@.
  .
  * Renamed the @Core.GraphicsState@ to @Core.GraphicProps@. 
    Moved the property datatypes from @Core.PictureInternal@ into 
    @Core.GraphicProps@ (StrokeProps, LabelProps, etc.).
  .
  * Moved @wumpus_default_font@ from @Core.Picture@ into 
    @Core.Graphic.Props@.
  .
  * Haddock docs improved.
