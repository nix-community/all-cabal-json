synopsis:         Pure Haskell PostScript and SVG generation. 
description:
  .
  Wumpus is a low-level library for generating static 2D vector 
  pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no FFI 
  dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Wumpus makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths 
  themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low-level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added and dropped between 
  releases, it has no stable API.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for @wumpus-core@ are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a 
  priority. 
  .  
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert EPS files generated by Wumpus to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.34.0 to 0.35.0:
  .
  * Bug fix - PostScript output - when more than one stroke 
    property changed the changes were concatenated without 
    a separator. This generated invalid PostScript. Now fixed.
  .
  * Documentation updates to the guide and the Haddock docs.
