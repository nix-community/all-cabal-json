synopsis:         Pure Haskell PostScript and SVG generation. 
description:
  .
  Wumpus is a low-level library for generating static 2D vector 
  pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no FFI 
  dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Wumpus makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths 
  themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low-level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added and dropped between 
  releases, it has no stable API.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for @wumpus-core@ are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a 
  priority. 
  .  
  NOTE version 0.37.0 - there will be no release of Wumpus-Basic
  to match this release of Wumpus-Core. Wumpus-Basic is 
  undergoing substantial change to accommodate glyph metrics and
  thus enable proper text bounding boxes and right and center
  aligned text. The improvements to Wumpus-Core merit a release
  so that there is not a large hiatus between the APIs of the 
  Hackage published latest version and the SVN repository.
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert EPS files generated by Wumpus to many other formats 
  (bitmaps).

  Changelog:
  . 
  0.36.0 to 0.37.0:
  .
  * The bounding box constructors have been renamed - @bbox@ is 
    now @boundingBox@ and @obbox@ becomes @oboundingBox@. The 
    rationale for this change is that the names very cryptic in 
    the first place and the constructors are used infrequently 
    when @bbox@ in particular makes a descriptive variable name.
  .
  * Changes to the Picture and Primitive types to enable better
    concatenation which is used heavily by Wumpus-Basic. The 
    Picture API exposes a new function @primCat@.
  .
  * SVG /font delta context/ change - font deltas are now 
    annotated on Primitives not Pictures. The type of the 
    function @fontDeltaContext@ in @Core.Picture@ has changed 
    accordingly.
  .
  * SVG hyperlink change - hyperlinks no longer group primitives
    (although a group of primitives can be hyperlinked). The 
    function @xlinkGroup@ has been removed from @Core.Picture@, 
    it is replaced by @xlink@. Primitives are now grouped with the
    function @primGroup@.
  .
  * @Core.Picture@ - the argument order for the function 
    @rtextlabel@ has been changed, the positions of the angle and 
    bottom-left corner have been swapped.
