  Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript. 
  .
  Wumpus is a library for generating 2D vector pictures, its 
  salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there 
  is no notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  Wumpus-core includes some extra helper modules that are not 
  really part of the \"core\", but are otherwise currently 
  homeless. They provide lists of named colours and /safe/ 
  fonts, plus some prototype code (Extra.PictureLanguage) for 
  arranging pictures.
  .
  WARNING...
  .
  The modules @Core.BoundingBox@ and @Extra.PictureLanguage@ are
  likely to be reworked significantly in the future. 
  .
  @Core.BoundingBox@ has too many functions that do not offer 
  distinct functionality. Some functions were removed in 
  revision 0.17.0 and some more are likely to follow. 
  .
  @Extra.PictureLanguage@ needs some more thought. The current 
  set of classes is rather cumbersome, and some of the operations 
  would benefit new names.
  .
  NOTE...
  .
  Revision 0.17.0 added affine transformations for primitives 
  (paths, text labels, ellipses), one consequence of this is 
  the bounding box may be tighter for a primitive under affine 
  transformation then lifted to a picture, than a primitive 
  lifted to picture then transformed, i.e.:
  . 
  @boundary (liftToPicture (transform PRIM)) /= boundary (transform (liftToPicture PRIM))@
  .
  Where liftToPicture is usually @frame@ from 
  @Wumpus.Core.Picture@.
  .
  This is because the bounding box of a transformed picture is 
  calculated by applying the transformation to the corner points 
  of its (previous) bounding box rather than finding the bounding 
  box union of all the composite primitives.
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. I\'m working on a complementary package 
  @wumpus-extra@ with higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.)
  but it is too unstable for Hackage. Preview releases can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/copperbox/> though.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation - which is 
  a priority. Text encoding an exception - I\'m not sure how 
  reasonable the design is. The current implementation 
  appears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other 
  character sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats 
  (bitmaps).

  Changelog:
  .
  0.18,0 to 0.19.0:
  .
  * Added @Transform@ type class to apply a matrix transformation
    directly.
  .
  * Changed the ordering of picture drawing in PostScript and SVG
    output so the list gets drawn from tail to head with right 
    folds. This makes the list order of pictures match their 
    zorder.
  .
  * Renamed the function @withinBB@ (Core.BoundingBox) to 
    @within@.
  .
  * On many type signatures with e.g. Points, I\'ve changed the 
    parameter name on the type constructor from @a@ to @u@.
    This is to indicate that @u@ is some unit - almost always a
    Double. e.g @Point2 a@ becomes @Point2 u@ and all the class
    obligations change lexically as well @Floating a =>@ to 
    @Floating u =>@. Superficially this means a lot of type 
    signatures have diffs but haven\'t really changed. 
  .
  * Added function @bezierCircle@ to generate the Bezier curve 
    points for arcs describing a circle.
  .
  * Added new demo - MultiPic. The PostScript it generates
    is efficient - no extraneous use of @concat@. 
  .
  * Added wumpus_default_font constant.
  .
  0.17.0 to 0.18.0:
  .
  * Added instances of the affine operation classes (Scale, 
    Rotate ...) for Primitives (path, text label, ellipse).
  .
  * Added some picture composition functions to Core.Picture.
    These are useful for testing where the type class 
    complications of Extra.PictureLanguage are an overhead.  
  .
  * Added iRGB to Core.Colour - create RGB colours with 
    integer components [0..255] - and iHSB, iGrey.
  .
  * Added some test modules for the affine transformations.
    These illustrate a quirk in Wumpus where, under affine 
    transformation, Pictures may generate a larger bounding box 
    than composite primitives.
  .
  * Minor change - ztextlabel changed to use 24pt type rather 
    than 12pt. 
  .
  * Corrected the cabal file to include the correct files for 
    the manual. The Haskell source file @WorldFrame.hs@ was 
    missing with the generated file @WorldFrame.eps@ incorrectly 
    included instead.
