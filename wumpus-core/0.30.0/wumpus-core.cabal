  Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript. 
  .
  Wumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures, 
  its salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added an dropped between 
  releases.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation - which is 
  a priority. Text encoding an exception - I\'m not sure how 
  reasonable the design is. The current implementation 
  appears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other 
  character sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.23.0 to 0.30.0:
  .
  * Substantial changes - the output machinery has been heavily 
    modified, the intention was to reduce the use of matrix 
    transformations in SVG output. Though this goal has not been 
    achieved, some code-size improvements in the SVG output have 
    been made. 
  .
  * The code generation monads have been changed - Wumpus no 
    longer uses a writer monad for code generation, but it will
    keep the Wumpus name.
  .
  * Added support for hyperlinks in the SVG output.
  .
  * Improved internal pretty printing and added the function 
    @printPicture@ for debugging.
  .
  * The @Core.Colour@ module has been simplified to support just 
    one (new) type - RGBi, and the conversion type class 
    @PSColour@ has been eliminated.
  .
  * @Core.Picture@ - the type of the @frame@ function has been 
    changed to take a list of Primitives rather than a single 
    Primitive. The function @frameMulti@ which previously 
    provided this functionality has been removed. SVG hyperlinks
    are now supported for Primitives. 
  . 
  * The default font size has been changed to 14 pt. 
  .
  * The Path datatype has been renamed PrimPath, likewise Ellipse 
    is now PrimEllispe and Label becomes PrimLabel.
  .
  * @Core.Geometry@ now longer defines an affine frame datatype.
  .
  * @Core.BoundingBox@ module changed significantly. The corner 
    functions (@boundaryBottomLeft@, etc.) have been removed, 
    along with the plane functions (@leftPlane@, etc.). Some 
    functions have been given more verbose names - @corners@ is 
    now @boundaryCorners@, @within@ is now @withinBoundary@ and 
    @union@ is now @boundaryUnion@. 
  .
  0.22.0 TO 0.23.0:
  . 
  * @Basic.GraphicsState@ - extracted the font face fields from 
    @FontAttr@ datatype into a separate datatype @FontFace@.
  . 
  * Added @PtSize@ a numeric type wrapping Double. This is 
    specifically for text size calculations, vis the 
    @Core.FontSize@ module.
  .
  * Changed all functions in @Core.FontSize@ to return @PtSize@
    instead of a polymorphic type @u@ (where @u@ is an instance 
    of Fractional). To get to another unit type rather than 
    FontSize use an explicit conversion that scales the value 
    accordingly.
  .
  * Added FromPtSize class constraints to various functions in
    @Core.Picture@.
  .
  * Added @charWidth@ to @Core.FontSize@.
  .
  * Added @vlength@ to @Core.Geometry@
  .
