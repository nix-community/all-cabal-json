description:
  .
  Wumpus-Core is a low-level library for generating static 2D 
  vector pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no 
  FFI dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized. 
  .
  Although Wumpus-Core only generates vector output, the generated 
  PostScript can be interpreted by GraphicsMagick or a similar 
  tool to convert EPS files into bitmap image files (e.g JPEGs).
  .
  Wumpus-Core makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths 
  themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no notion of a 
  current point, Wumpus-Core builds pictures in a coordinate-free 
  style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually building pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus-Core is 
  very low-level. There are two supplementary packages 
  @Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@ also on Hackage that aim to 
  be a higher-level basis for creating certain types of diagram, 
  but they are experimental - functionality is added and dropped 
  between releases and curently the API is too unstable to write 
  code upon (they should be considered a technology preview rather
  than re-usable libraries).
  .
  Also, some of the design decisions made for Wumpus-Core are not 
  sophisticated - e.g. how path and text attributes like colour 
  are handled, and how the bounding boxes of text labels are 
  calculated. Compared to other systems, Wumpus might be rather 
  limited, however, the design permits a fairly simple 
  implementation.
  .

  Changelog:
  . 
  v0.51.0 to v0.52.0:
  .
  * Added limited support for adding SVG ids to text and 
    Primitives.
  .
  * Fixed types of @d2r@ and @r2d@ to Double for degrees, rather 
    than a parametric (Real a, Floating a) type. Although this is
    less general, it removes the burden of type annotating the 
    common case.
  .
  * Added the vector functions @orthoVec@, @vsum@ and @vdiff@ to 
    @Core.Geometry@.
  .
  * Re-named @clip@ to @clipPrimitive@
  .
  v0.50.0 to v0.51.0:
  .
  * Added special cases to handle continuity to the function 
    @lineDirection@ in @Core.Geometry@.
  .
  * Added @zeroVec@ to @Core.Geometry@.
  . 
  * Extended some Haddock documentation.
  .
  v0.43.0 to v0.50.0:
  .
  * Major change hence the version number jump - the notion of 
    parametric unit has been removed from the @Picture@ objects 
    (it for remains the @Geometric@ objects @Point2@, @Vec2@ etc.). 
    Certain useful units, e.g. @em@ and @en@, are contextual on 
    the \"current point size\", and having a parametric unit here 
    was actually a hinderance to supporting units properly in 
    higher-level layers. Now all Picture objects (those defined 
    or exported from @Core.Picture@) are fixed to use Double 
    - representing PostScript points. Higher level layers that 
    intend to support alternative units must translate drawing 
    objects to PostScript point measurements /before/ calling the 
    Picture API. Geometric objects - objects defined in 
    @Core.Geometry@, e.g. @Point2@, @Vec2@ - are still polymorphic 
    on unit. 
  .  
  * Picture API change - Various function names changed.
    @lineTo@ becomes @absLineTo@ and @curveTo@ becomes 
    @absCurveTo@. The path builders are qualified with /Prim/, 
    @vertexPath@ becomes @vertexPrimPath@, @vectorPath@ becomes 
    @vectorPrimPath@, @emptyPath@ becomes @emptyPrimPath@ and 
    @curvedPath@ becomes @curvedPrimPath@. @xlink@ becomes 
    @xlinkPrim@.
  . 
  * API change - @PtSize@ data type replaced by @AfmUnit@ for font 
    measurements.
  .
  * API and representation change - clipping paths are represented
    as @Primitive@ constructor rather than a @Picture@ constructor.
    This should make them more useful. The type of the function 
    @clip@ in @Core.Picture@ has likewise changed.
  .
  * Picture API change - changed @primPath@ to @absPrimPath@, added
    the functions @relPrimPath@, @relLineTo@, @relCurveTo@.
  . 
  * Added the class @Tolerance@ to @Core.Geometry@ and made the Eq 
    instances of @Point2@, @Vec2@ and @BoundingBox@ tolerant. 
    Tolerance accounts for a fairly lax equality on floating point 
    numbers - it is suitable for Wumpus (printing) where high 
    accuracy is needed.
  .
  v0.42.1 to v0.43.0:
  .
  * API change - the function @bezierCircle@ in @Core.Geometry@
    has changed. It now implements a better method of drawing 
    circles with Bezier curves and no longer needs the 
    subvision factor. The old circle drawing function has been 
    retained as @subdivisionCircle@ as it is useful for 
    corroborating @bezierCircle@, but the general use of 
    @subdivisionCircle@ should be avoided.
  . 
  * Added a function @bezierEllipse@ to @Core.Geometry@.
