name:                network-socket-options
version:             0.2
synopsis:            Type-safe, portable alternative to getSocketOption/setSocketOption
description:
    The network package provides getSocketOption and setSocketOption functions.
    These work fine for socket options represented using the @int@ type
    (namely, all boolean options, and a few quantity options).  However, it
    doesn't work for, say, @SO_LINGER@, @SO_RCVTIMEO@, and @SO_SNDTIMEO@, as
    these use different, platform-specific representations.
    .
    This package implements the getters and setters as separate functions.  At
    the moment, it only provides socket options that are available for both
    Unix and Windows.
    .
    This package also provides a workaround needed to time out network
    operations in Windows without leaking resources.
