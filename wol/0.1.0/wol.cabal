                     .
                     This program is useful if you have a computer that you
                     keep at a friend's house because he has a fast internet
                     connection. But he keeps turning the machine off, saying
                     that it warms up his room and your not using it anyway.
                     But now you need a way to turn the machine back on...
                     .

                     .
