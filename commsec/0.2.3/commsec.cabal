name:                commsec
version:             0.2.3
synopsis:            Provide communications security using symmetric ephemeral keys
description:         This package provides confidentiallity,
                     integrity and replay detection. Users must
                     provide ephemeral keys for one time use (reuse
                     will compromise the security guarentees).
                     Starting with shared secret, this package
                     builds bi-directional channels for datagram
                     based communication.
