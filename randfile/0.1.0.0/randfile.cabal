version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Program for picking a random file
description:
    This program selects a random file from the current directory, including
    files in subdirectories.  If you like to manage your music collection using
    the command line, this program can be used to approximate \"shuffle\".
    .
    More precisely, it starts at the current directory, picks a random entry,
    and descends if it is a directory.  It does not give more weight to
    directories containing more files.  It should only fail if there are no
    regular files under the current directory that you can see.
    .
    If you are wondering why I bothered to use crypto-grade random number
    generation, it is because I found @System.Random@ to be unsatisfactory.
    With @System.Random@, this program tended to return the same file
    repeatedly.
    .
    Note: on Unix, this program follows symbolic links, while on Windows, it
    doesn't.  Symbolic links were introduced in Windows Vista and
    Windows Server 2008.
