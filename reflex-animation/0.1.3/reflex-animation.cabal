synopsis:            Continuous animations support for reflex
description:         This package provides a set of functions for creating and playing continuous animations of the form Time -> a.
                     Finite animations (with a length) and infinite animations complement one another, we chose a representation of 
                     finite animations which has only a length (and not a starting point) to keep things simple. If needed such animations
                     can be converted to infinite animations, combined, and clipped as required.
