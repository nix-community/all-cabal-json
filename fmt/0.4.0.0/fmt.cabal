synopsis:            A new formatting library
description:
  A new formatting library that tries to be simple to understand while still
  being powerful and providing more convenience features than other libraries
  (like functions for pretty-printing maps and lists, or a function for
  printing arbitrary datatypes using generics).
  .
  A comparison with other libraries:
  .
  * @printf@ (from @Text.Printf@) takes a formatting string and uses some
    type tricks to accept the rest of the arguments polyvariadically. It's
    very concise, but there are some drawbacks â€“ it can't produce @Text@
    (you'd have to @T.pack@ it every time) and it doesn't warn you at
    compile-time if you pass wrong arguments or not enough of them.
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-format text-format> takes a
    formatting string with angle brackets denoting places where arguments
    would be substituted (the arguments themselves are provided via a
    tuple). If you want to apply formatting to some of the arguments, you
    have to use one of the provided formatters. Like @printf@, it can fail at
    runtime, but at least the formatters are first-class (and you can add new
    ones).
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting formatting> takes a
    formatting template consisting of pieces of strings interleaved with
    formatters; this ensures that arguments always match their placeholders.
    @formatting@ provides lots of formatters and generally seems to be the
    most popular formatting library here. Unfortunately, at least in my
    experience writing new formatters can be awkward and people sometimes
    have troubles understanding how @formatting@ works.
  .
  * <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt fmt> (i.e. this library)
    provides formatters that are ordinary functions, and a bunch of operators
    for concatenating formatted strings; those operators also do automatic
    conversion. There are some convenience formatters which aren't present in
    @formatting@ (like ones for formatting maps, lists, converting to base64,
    etc). Some find the operator syntax annoying, while others like it.
