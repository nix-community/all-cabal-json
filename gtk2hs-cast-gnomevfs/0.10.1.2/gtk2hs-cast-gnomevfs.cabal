synopsis: A type class for cast functions of Gtk2hs: gnomevfs package
description:
 This package contains a type class called Cast with a function cast, that is a
 wrapper for all the castTo* functions of gtk2hs.  It makes it easier to write
 other functions that require a castTo* as a parameter, like xmlGetWidget from
 glade.  The main utility of these packages is to use xmlGetWidgetCast, a
 version of xmlGetWidget defined in gtk2hs-cast-glade, which has the type:
 xmlGetWidgetCast :: (Cast widget, WidgetClass widget) => GladeXML -> String ->
 IO widget.
 .
 This is the gnomevfs package of gtk2hs-cast, which contains the instances of
 Cast for the types in the gnomevfs package from gtk2hs.
