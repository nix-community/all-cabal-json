-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:             Unofficial Haskell Client Library for the Orchestrate.io API

-- A longer description of the package.
description:          An implementation of most of the functions of the Orchestrate.io REST API in Haskell.
                      To get started, see the documentation for the Orchestrate and  Orchestrate.REST module below.
                      Because this module does use 'Data.Aeson' for parsing and encoding JSON you might want to take a look at it's docs too.
                      For some working examples check out the "examples/Test.hs" file and the documentation.
