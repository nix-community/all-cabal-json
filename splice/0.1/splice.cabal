synopsis:      Socket to Socket Data Splicing
description:   A library that implements efficient socket to socket
               data transfer loops for proxy servers.
               .
               On Linux, it uses the zero-copy splice() system call:
               <http://kerneltrap.org/node/6505>.
               .
               On all other operating systems, it currently falls back
               to a portable Haskell implementation that allocates a
               constant-sized memory buffer before it enters an inner
               loop which then uses hGetBufSome and hPutBuf; this avoids
               lots of tiny allocations as would otherwise be caused by
               recv and sendAll functions from Network.Socket.ByteString.
               .
