                        The bytestring-0.9.1.5 update on hackage seems to have 
                        cratered the build for many packages, including the last
                        several versions of this one, so this version will
                        probably not build properly on the hackage site. 
                        As far as I know, though, that is the only reason
                        it fails. This version includes a hack to try to make
                        it build on the site, triggered by the HaXml_1_13 build flag.

flag new-data-object
  description:          Use the new version of the data-object package (>= 0.0.2)
                        Which has a "generic object" type in place of the simpler
                        Object type in previous versions.
  default:              True

flag new-template-haskell
  description:          Template Haskell 2.4 seems to have made the
                        generated @PropertyListItem OneOfN@ instances break.
                        So, detect it and deal with it.

flag HaXml_1_13
  default:              False
  description:          The Hackage website builder is currently very finicky
                        and the bytestring-0.9.1.5 update has made me very
                        frustrated, because the last several versions of this
                        package have failed to build because of it.  
                        The "preferred-versions" fallback fails too, because
                        the additional HaXml constraint combined with the
                        one here becomes unsatisfiable.  So, I'm gonna make
                        this thing work with HaXml 1.13 now.  
                        
                        And, as an additional hack to make sure it works, 
                        this flag will also trigger dependencies on specific 
                        versions of packages known to have been built against 
                        bytestring-0.9.1.4 on the hackage server.
                        
                        Once ghc-6.12 is released, this should no longer be
                        a problem and I can clean up the mess I've made here.
