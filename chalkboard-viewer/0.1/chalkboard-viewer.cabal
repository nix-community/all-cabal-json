Synopsis:            OpenGL based viewer for chalkboard rendered images. 
Description:	     Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for image generation and processing.
		The basic structure is a chalk board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically colors. 
		Chalkboard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function mapping,
		cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones.
		.		
		Chalkboard Viewer is a portal into a dynamically updatable Board, via an OpenGL window.
