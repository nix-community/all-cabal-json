description:
                Parameter training for RNA secondary structure prediction tools
                requires data to train on. Since there are a number of
                different available formats, and handling them all in the
                training tools is a pain, we have this library and programs.
                "MkTrainingData" transforms different formats and they all
                produce a common "training data" format. This format is
                Haskell-readable (and only partially human-readable)
                line-by-line. Generating additional training data is therefor
                easy as one can just "cat" together different training files.
                .
                Note that several features are designed around /extended/ RNA
                secondary structures.
                .
                Now with some filtering and manipulation options.
