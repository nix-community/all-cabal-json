description:
  Package @curlhs@ provides a mid-level interface to @libcurl@, the
  multiprotocol file transfer library which powers the popular tool @curl@
  (please see <http://curl.haxx.se/> for more info). As described on the
  @libcurl@'s project site (<http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>):
  .
  /libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library,       /
  /supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, /
  /LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP.  /
  /libcurl supports SSL certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading,    /
  /HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, user+password authentication    /
  /(Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, Kerberos), file transfer resume,         /
  /http proxy tunneling and more!                                            /
  .
  /libcurl is highly portable, it builds and works identically on numerous   /
  /platforms, including Solaris, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, HPUX,     /
  /IRIX, AIX, Tru64, Linux, UnixWare, HURD, Windows, Amiga, OS/\//2, BeOs,   /
  /Mac OS X, Ultrix, QNX, OpenVMS, RISC OS, Novell NetWare, DOS and more...  /
  .
  /libcurl is free, thread-safe, IPv6 compatible, feature rich, well         /
  /supported, fast, thoroughly documented and is already used by many        /
  /known, big and successful companies and numerous applications.            /
  .
  Package @curlhs@ depends on @libcurl@ as an external library. To compile
  and later use @curlhs@, it is required to first install @libcurl@ somewhere
  on the system, best in place that is easy to locate by the compiler.
  Information about how to compile and install @libcurl@ may be found on
  its project site. A simple way may be to use one of the available
  precompiled packages.
  .
  Current version of @curlhs@ follows @libcurl@ in version 7.25.0. It is
  also possible to use @curlhs@ with older versions of @libcurl@, but some
  features may not be available then (@curlhs@ should easily compile
  with @libcurl@ from version 7.20.0 upward).
  .
  Package is distributed under ISC License (MIT/BSD-style, see LICENSE file
  for details). It is marked as @OtherLicense@ due to limitations of Cabal.
