name:                minimorph
version:             0.1.5.0
synopsis:            English spelling functions with an emphasis on simplicity.
description:         A set of simplistic functions capturing the more regular
                     parts of English spelling (for generation, not parsing).
                     You will need to complement this with some account for
                     irregular nouns/verbs. This package is not meant to provide
                     anything resembling a full account of English morphology
                     (something like Functional Morphology or sequor could be
                     better suited). The main goal is to provide something cheap
                     and cheerful with no learning curve, that you can use until
                     your application calls for more robustness.
