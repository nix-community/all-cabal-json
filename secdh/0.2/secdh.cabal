description:         SECDH stands for "Stack-Environment-Code-Dump-Heap", and is an
                     abstract machine based on Landin's classic SECD machine for evaluation
                     of lambda-calculus expressions. This machine adds a heap of suspension
                     cells to the structure managed by the machine, allowing fully-lazy
                     evaluation, similar to Haskell. The machine operates directly on the
                     syntax tree, as Landin's machine does. The entire implementation,
                     including parser, evaluator, and garbage collector, occupies just over
                     1100 lines of code.
