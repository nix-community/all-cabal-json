synopsis:            Create dynamic HTML in the browser using blaze-html-style notation with Haste 
description:         Perch defines builder elements (perchs) for Haste.DOM elements that are appendable, so that dynamic HTML can be created in the client in a natural way, like textual HTML, but programmatically and with the advantage of static type checking. It can be ported to other haskell-js compilers
                     .
                     Haste is a compiler that generates Javascript code from Haskell.
                     .

                     .
                     The Haste.DOM module define a thin layer over the JavaScript DOM. The DOM is a low level HTML tree manipulation API. That makes the creation and manipulation of DOM elements almost as painful as in JavaScript.
                     .
                     This package makes the creation of DOM elements easy with a syntax similar to other haskell HTML generators, using monoids and monads, such is the case of the package blaze-html.

                     .
                     Since the creation is in the browser, that permit quite dynamic pages for data
                     presentation, and interctive textual (a.k.a "serious") applications and in general
                     the development of client-side web frameworks using haskell with the haste compiler.
