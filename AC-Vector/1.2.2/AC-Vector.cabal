Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Name:          AC-Vector
Version:       1.2.2
Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Efficient geometric vectors.

Description:

  This Haskell library implements several small vectors types
  with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of
  vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.

  Changes:

  * /All prior versions/ of this library have a faulty
    implementation of 'vcross'. Specifically, the sign of
    the Y-coordinate is inverted. Oops!
