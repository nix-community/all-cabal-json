Synopsis: wrapper for expat, the fast XML parser
Description:
  Expat (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/>) is a stream-oriented XML parser
  written in C.  It is known for being simple and fast.
  .
  There are already nice XML libraries in the Text.XML hierarchy.  The
  reason to use Expat is when speed is of concern.  From a benchmark
  that compares getting the length of the root node of a HaXml tree
  (presumably forcing parsing the entire file) against running an Expat
  parser with a registered start node handler, Expat is about 12 times
  faster.  This is not a fair benchmark; HaXml does a lot more than this
  Expat library.  But if Expat suffices, it is good for what it does.
