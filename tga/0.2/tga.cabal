Name:             tga
Version:          0.2
Synopsis:         Reading and writing of tga image files
Description:      TGA is a very simple format (like Bitmap), but in contrast to Bitmap also stores an alpha channel for transparency. Although tga might be outdated it had to be implemented because stb-image only supports reading. This version supports raw RGB24 and RGB32 data without palettes or run length encoding
