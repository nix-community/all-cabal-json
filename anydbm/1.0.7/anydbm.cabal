synopsis: Interface for DBM-like database systems
Description:  This module provides a generic infrastructure for supporting storage
 of hash-like items with String-to-String mappings.  It can be used
 for in-memory or on-disk storage.
 .
 Two simple backend drivers are included with this package: one
 that is RAM-only, and one that is persistent and disk-backed.
 The hdbc-anydbm package provides another driver, which lets you use
 simple tables in any SQL database to provide a DBM-like interface.
 MissingPy also provides a Python driver which lets you use any
 Python anydbm driver under Haskell AnyDBM.
