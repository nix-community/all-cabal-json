name:             syntax-trees
version:          0.1
synopsis:         Convert between different Haskell syntax trees.
description:      Provides an instance that translates
		  haskell-src-exts expression trees into Template Haskell expression
		  trees in a way that depends only on the haskell-src-exts syntax tree
		  and agreement on the pretty-printed representation of
		  Haskell between haskell-src-exts pretty-printer and
		  Template Haskell quotations (as opposed to depending on
		  both TH and haskell-src-exts syntax tree representations).
		  .
		  Instead of converting between data types, 
		  haskell-src-exts syntax trees are pretty-printed and wrapped in
		  a TH quotation which is then interpreted as a Haskell program,
		  yielding a TH Exp tree. Free variables in the haskell-src-exts tree are
		  preserved by lifting them to TH splices prior to pretty-printing.
		  .
