name: pipes-attoparsec-streaming
version: 0.1.0.0
synopsis: Streaming parsing in the pipes-core framework with Attoparsec.
description: This module exports the single function parse, which can be used to
  run an Attoparsec parser in a streaming fashion, which means that
  the parser is not only run incrementally across the input (which
  can be done with plain Attoparsec or packages like
  pipes-attoparsec), but that the parse results are delivered
  incrementally.  This package can be seen as a kind of dual to
  pipes-attoparsec: the latter runs parser incrementally over their
  input, whereas the former incrementally delivers output.
