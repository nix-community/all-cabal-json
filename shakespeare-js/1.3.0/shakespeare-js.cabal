description:
    Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with simple variable interpolation. Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates variables according to the type being inserted.
    In this case, the variable type needs a ToJavascript instance.
    .
    shakespeare-javascript is also known as Julius, and passes through plain javascript.
    .
    There is also a shakespeare version for CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and Roy, all languages that compile down to Javascript. They all expect you to have the appropriate compiler in your path.
    .
    shakespeare originated from the hamlet template package.
