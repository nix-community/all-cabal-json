Synopsis: a FFI utility
Description: 
  errno is a small utility to supplement the FFI.
  Many C functions will return a special Int if an error
  has occurred, and the withErrno* functions allow you
  to lift them into the ErrorT String transformer.
  I found this in some cases useful for when I wanted
  to handle errors from both C & Haskell on equal
  footing.
