synopsis:            Orphan mtl instances for ExceptT from transformers-compat
description:         This package backports the "Control.Monad.Except" module (if
                     using @mtl-2.2.0.1@ or earlier) and monad class instances for
                     @ExceptT@ from @transformers-compat@ (if using @mtl-2.1.3.1@
                     or earlier).
                     .
                     Note that unlike how @mtl-2.2@ or later works, the
                     "Control.Monad.Except" module defined in this package exports
                     all of @ExceptT@'s monad class instances. Therefore, you may 
                     have to declare @import Control.Monad.Except ()@ at the top of
                     your file to get all of the @ExceptT@ instances in scope.
