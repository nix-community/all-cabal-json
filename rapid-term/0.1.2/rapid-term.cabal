description:  When developing interactive command line applications in
    an editor like Emacs GHCi typically has no access to an actual
    terminal.  This is good enough for applications that only read lines
    from stdin and print diagnostics to stdout, but as soon as terminal
    functionality is needed, the application has to be tested elsewhere.
    .
    This package provides functionality that, when used together with
    the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rapid rapid library>, can
    open a persistent terminal that the application can access directly,
    such that terminal applications can be tested with the main GHCi
    instance.
    .
    You can find a tutorial in the documentation of the @Rapid.Term@
    module.
