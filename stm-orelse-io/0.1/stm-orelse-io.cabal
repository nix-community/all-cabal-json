Description:         While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself
		     wanting to wait for an IO operation /unless/ something
		     more important came up. The "Control.Concurrent.STM.OrElseIO"
		     module is meant to reduce the boilerplate needed when choosing
		     between IO actions and STM operations.
		     .
		     You must use the threaded runtime with this package.
		     .
		     TODO:
		     .
		     * Kill off IO threads whose return values will never be needed.
		     .
		     * Possibly rename @runOrElse@ and friends to @orElseIO@ or similar.
