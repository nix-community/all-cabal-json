Name:             SVGFonts
Version:          1.0
Synopsis:         Fonts from the SVG-Font format
Description:      This format is easy to parse and was therefore chosen for a font library
                  completely written in Haskell
                  .
                  You can convert your own font to SVG with <http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/> or use the included LinLibertine, Bitstream
                  .
                  Features
                  .
                  * A powerful functional interface, demonstrated with an example (Fonts.hs)
                  .
                  * The generated outlines can be transformed in various ways, i.e.
                    elimination of holes for triangulation, representation with triangles, extrusion
                  .
                  * Color textures that are stored as files (font cache). Foreground and background color can be freely chosen.
                  .
                  * Everything is stored in a simple SceneGraph: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/collada-types>
                  .
                  * Complete implementation of the features that fontforge produces (but not the complete SVG format):
                  .
                  * Kerning (i.e. the two characters in \"VA\" have a shorter distance than in \"VV\")
                  .
                  * Unicode, Ligatures
                  .
                  XML speed issues can be solved by trimming the svg file to only those characters that are used (or maybe binary xml one day)
                  .
