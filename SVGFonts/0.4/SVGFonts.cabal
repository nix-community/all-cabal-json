Name:             SVGFonts
Version:          0.4
Synopsis:         Fonts from the SVG-Font format
Description:      SVG-Font is a very easy to parse format and was therefore chosen for a font library
                  completely written in Haskell
                  .
                  To use this library with your own font, the font has to be converted with <http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/>
				  Features
                  .
                  * A very easy and powerful functional interface, see the Font.hs example
                  .
                  * The generated outlines can be transformed in various ways, i.e.
                    elimination of holes for easy extrusion (with the triangulation library)
                  .
                  * complete implementation of the SVG-Font format, that allows Kerning
                    (i.e. the two characters in "VA" have a shorter distance than in "VV")
                  .
                  * Everything is stored in a simple SceneGraph data type: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/collada-types>
                  .
                  .
                  Some speed issues are left to be solved (xml) and rasterization is not finnished
                  .
                  Speed issues can be solved by trimming the svg file to only those characters that are used
                  .
