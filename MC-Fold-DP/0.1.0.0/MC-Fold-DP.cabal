                Folding algorithm based on nucleotide cyclic motifs.
description:
                This is a RNA secondary structure prediction tool based on the
                idea of combining small motifs, called nucleotide cyclic motifs
                (NCMs). The algorithm implemented here and described in
                .

                has polynomial runtime in O(n^3) and uses a (pseudo-energy)
                scoring scheme based on
                .

                RNA structure from sequence data",  Nature 2008,

                .
                This program uses the same database as MC-Fold (which has
                exponential run-time) and aims to be able to produce the same
                results.
                .
                The underlying grammar of our implementation is unambiguous and
                allows the complete evaluation of all structures within an
                energy band above the ground state, presenting each unique
                structure just once. Alternatively, the grammar allows
                partition function calculations.
                .
                Current status:
                .
                * comparable prediction accuracy on sequences
                .
                * possibility to use sparse data correction
                .
                * handles non-ACGU nucleotides gracefully
                .
                * suboptimals: return all structures within an energy band above the ground state
                .
                Todo:
                .
                * Boltzmann likelihood calculations
                .
                * pseudoknot calculations (currently aiming for a pknotsRG-like algorithm)
