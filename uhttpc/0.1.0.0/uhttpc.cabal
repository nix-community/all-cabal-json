description:
  @uhttpc@ contains a simple low-level and lightweight Haskell
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616 HTTP 1.1>
  library optimized for providing the bare minimum required for HTTP
  benchmarking purposes and allowing for time measurements of the
  individual phases of the HTTP transaction.
  .
  This package also provides the command-line tool @uhttpc-bench@ as an
  usage example which mimics the popular
  <https://github.com/lighttpd/weighttp weighttp> HTTP benchmarking tool's
  CLI.
  .
  WARNING: @uhttpc@ was originally developed for evaluating the new
  <http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask035-voellmy.pdf \"Mio\" parallel I/O manager>
  introduced with GHC 7.8 and provide a base-line for HTTP client libraries.
  However, this is not a fully RFC compliant HTTP client library and
  therefore ought not be used as a general purpose HTTP
  implementation; Use libraries such as
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams http-streams>
  instead which aim toward full RFC compliance as well as having good
  performance.
