synopsis:            type safe rpcs provided as basic IO actions
description:         Given an address of a server sharing a set of functions,
                     this rpc library generates functions of the same name for
                     a client, preformed within the IO monad.  Calling
                     these results in the original function being executed
                     server side.  The pseudo-functions generated maintain
                     their original server side type (except for the added IO).
