synopsis:            derives heuristic rules from nominal data
description:         utility that reads a table in a csv (comma
       separated) format that can be generated from 
       Open Office Calc (spreadsheet), derives all shortest rules
       for a selected attribute, and writes them to a .csv file
       that can be read by OO Calc. The shortest rules may be
       partially ordered by implication (entailment) and equivalence
       (equality) and the top level is also shown in .csv format.
       Optionally all logical entailments and equalities are listed
       as well. If the data set contains ambiguous rules or more
       occurrences of the same rule the user is warned.
