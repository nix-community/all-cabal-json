synopsis:            derives heuristic rules from nominal data
description:         utility that reads a table in a csv (comma separated) format that can be generated from
                     Open Office Calc (spreadsheet), derives all shortest rules for a selected attribute,
                     and writes them to a .csv file that can be read by OO Calc. The shortest rules may be
                     partially ordered by implication (entailment) and equivalence (equality) and this partial
                     order is shown in Graphviz readable .dot files. Emping has a Gtk2Hs based GUI.
