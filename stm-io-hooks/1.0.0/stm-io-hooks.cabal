Name:           stm-io-hooks
Synopsis:       STM with IO hooks
Description:
    This library provides a Software Transactional Memory (STM) monad with commit and retry IO hooks. 
    A retry-action is run (at least once) if the transaction retries, while commit-actions are 
    executed iff the transaction commits. The AdvSTM monad also gives some atomicity
    guarantees for commit-actions:
    .
    * When a TVar is modified in a transaction and this transaction commits,
    the update remains invisible to other threads until the corresponding 
    onCommit action is run. 
    .
    * If the onCommit action throws an exception, the original values of 
    the modified TVars are restored.
    .
    Note: The package can be used as a drop-in replacement for 
    'Control.Concurrent.STM'. 
    .
    Feedback is welcome!
