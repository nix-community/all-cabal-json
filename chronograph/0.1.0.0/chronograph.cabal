name:                chronograph
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            measure timings of data evaluation
description:         The 'Chronograph' data structure adds a measure field
                     to an existing Haskell expression.  This field will be the
                     time necessary to evaluate the expression using an
                     arbitrary evaluation strategy (WHNF by default).
                     .
                     Chronograph preserves laziness, so that the work of
                     performing the evaluation is only done after the result is
                     demanded.
                     .
                     If you want to benchmark your program, you should look to
                     other packages like Criterion that perform statistical
                     analysis of your results so you can determine how reliable
                     they are.  Chronograph just takes measurements, leaving
                     the interpretation entirely to you.
