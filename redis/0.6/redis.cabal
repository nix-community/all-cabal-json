Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:
    Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached
    but the dataset is not volatile. Values can be strings, exactly
    like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.
    .
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. Note that this library
	supports the most recent (actually the git one) version of Redis
	protocol. Most of the functions will work correctly with stable version
	but not all.
	.
	Changes from v0.5:
	.
	- zunion and zinter was renamed to zunionstore and zinterstore.
	  Important! It makes this version incompatible with older versions of Redis server.
	.
	- new message type for pmessages: MPMessage
	.
	- new reply type RParseError used for replies that was failed to convert from ByteString
	.
	- new command added: setEx

Stability:           beta
