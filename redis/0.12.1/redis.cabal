Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:
	Redis (<http://redis.io>) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced
	key-value store. It is often referred as a data structure server
	since keys can contain different data structures, such as strings,
	hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.
    .
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. It's tested with
    current git version and with v2.4.6 of redis server. It also
    tested with v2.2 and basic functions are works correctly
    but not all of them.
	.
	You can use Test module from the source package to run unit
	tests. Try /runhaskell Test.hs --help/ for usage info. Caution! Do not
	run tests on your working database - test database will be
	flushed.
	.
	There are simple benchmark module included: Benchmark.hs. It shows
	me about two times less requests per second than redis-benchmark
	from server distribution.
	.
	Please let me know if tests or benchmark goes terribly wrong.
	.
	Changes from v0.11:
	.
	- Drop parsec dependency
	.
	- New commands implemented: incrbyfloat and hincrbyfloat
	.
	- Added variadic versions of del, hdel, lpush, rpush, sadd, srem,
      zadd, zrem (named as del_, hdel_ etc.)
	.
	- Fixed compilation with GHC 7.2 (and hopefully with more recent
      versions too), thanks Ben Gamari and Sean Hess for reporting.
	.
	- Using RLock from concurrent-extra fixes multithreading issues,
      thanks Dmitry Dzhus for reporting
	.
	- Hopefully, fix building on Windows (untested), thanks Piotr
      Staszewski and Alexander Dorofeev
	.
