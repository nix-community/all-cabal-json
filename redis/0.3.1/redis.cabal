Synopsis:            A driver for Redis key-value database
Description:
    Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached
    but the dataset is not volatile. Values can be strings, exactly
    like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.
    .
    This library is a Haskell driver for Redis. Note that this library
	supports the most recent (actually the git one) version of Redis
	protocol. Most of the functions will work correctly with stable version
	but not all.
	.
	Changes from v0.2:
	.
	- (!) A lot of data and function types changed. Now it is posible to get not only
	  String result but also a ByteString and other.
	.
	- New protocol functions added: substr, zrank

Stability:           beta
