name:                quicklz
version:             1.5.0.11
synopsis:            QuickLZ compression for ByteStrings
description:
  This package provides a high level binding to the QuickLZ
  compression library for @ByteStrings@, under the GPLv2
  license. QuickLZ is fast and compresses very well. Check out the
  home page: <http://quicklz.com>
  .
  This package includes the QuickLZ 1.5.0 source code, at
  compression level 1 and streaming mode disabled.
  .
  The versioning scheme for this package is unusual. QuickLZ tries to
  be as fast as possible, and will break backwards compatibility to
  achieve it in newer versions. This versioning scheme reflects the
  QuickLZ versioning scheme: the first three digits of version w.x.y.z
  are the quicklz version, with the 'z' component (and any further
  needed ones) being updates to this package, not quicklz itself.
