synopsis:            GRASP implementation for the AMMM project. 
description:
            = Brief summary
            This is part of the final project for the AMMM (MIRI, FIB-UPC) subject.
            It contains the random instance generator plus all the GRASP part.
            .
            It is hosted at https://bitbucket.org/janmasrovira/am3-project.
            .
            This package includes:
            .
            * A polymorphic GRASP implementation.
            * A random instance generator for the AM3 project.
            * The @AM3@ folder contains the code specific to the final project for
            the Algorithmic Methods for Mathematical Models subject
            (Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics, FIB-UPC).
            .
            = Contents
            Make sure to read the documentation of all the modules listed below.
            .
            Specifically, the contents of each module (sorted by relevance to the project) are:
            .
            1. "GRASP": A polymorphic parameterizable implementation of a Greedy Randomized
            Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP).
            The idea is taken from this paper: http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2001/09/371.pdf.
            It does not contain anything that is specific to the AM3 project.
            2. "AM3.Solution": Contains all the specific functions to the solution of an
            instance of the AM3 project.
            3. "AM3.RandomInstance": A parameterizable random generator of instances.
            4. "AM3.Instance": An instance of the problem. It also provides useful functions that
            have to do with constructing, querying, importing, exporting... an instance.
