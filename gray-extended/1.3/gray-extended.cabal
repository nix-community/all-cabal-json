synopsis:       Gray encoding schemes
description:    Gray codes satisfy the property that two successive values 
                differ in only one digit. Usually the term \"Gray code\"
                refers to the Binary Reflected Gray code (BRGC),  but 
                non-binary Gray codes have also been discovered.
