-- A longer description of the package.
description:         
  Provides functions for generating mountain-like terrain structure using a
  random walk algorithm. Inspired by Pickover's 1998 article \"Vacation
  on Mars\". The data can be output as an ascii-format PLY file, or viewed
  \"overhead\" as an intensity graph. The PLY file can be loaded into a 3D
  modeling program such as Blender.
