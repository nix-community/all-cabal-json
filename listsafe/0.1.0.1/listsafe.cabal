synopsis:            Safe wrappers for partial list functions, supporting MonadThrow.
description:         Data.List includes a handful of partial functions that throw
                     uncatchable exceptions when given empty lists. This package
                     provides safe alternatives for such functions based on
                     MonadThrow which can provide a variety of failure
                     cases: Nothing, IOException, Left, etc.
