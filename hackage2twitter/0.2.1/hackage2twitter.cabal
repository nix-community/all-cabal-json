synopsis:            Send new Hackage releases to Twitter
description:         Build on the `feed2twitter` library, this program reads
                     the Hackage RSS feed and tweets each new release to
                     Twitter.
                     .
                     The Hackage feed is read only once. To keep updating, call
                     this program every few minutes in a cron job.
                     .
                     A local cache of the last 20 tweets is kept in a file to
                     make sure no duplicates are sent.
                     .
                     Usage:
                     .
                     > $ hackage2twitter username password cache-file [--debug-mode]
