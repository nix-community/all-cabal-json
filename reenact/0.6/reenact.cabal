description: 
    Reenact is a reimplementation of the "Reactive" library by Conal Elliot.

    It preserves semantics and most operators of the original library. In
    particular the @Monoid@, @Applicative@ and @Monad@ instances for 
    @Events@, @Reactives@ and @Behaviours@ are available and have the original semantics.

    The implementation however is completely different, based on asynchronous
    channels instead of the @unamb@ operator.
