description: 
    Reenact is a reimplementation of the /Reactive/ library by Conal Elliott.

    It preserves semantics and most operators of the original library. In
    particular the 'Monoid', 'Applicative' and 'Monad' instances for 
    'Events', 'Reactives' and 'Behaviours' are available and have the original semantics.

    The implementation however is completely different, based on asynchronous
    channels instead of the 'unamb' operator.
