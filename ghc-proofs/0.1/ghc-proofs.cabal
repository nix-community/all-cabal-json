synopsis:            GHC plugin to prove program equations by simplification
description:         Often when writing Haskel code, one would like to prove things about the code.
                     .
                     A good example is writing an 'Applicative' or 'Monad'
                     instance: there are equation that should hold, and
                     checking them manually is tedious.
                     .
                     Wouldn’t it be nice if the compiler could check them for
                     us? With this plugin, he can! (At least in certain simple
                     cases – for everything else, you have to use a more
                     dedicated solution.)
                     .
                     See the documentation in "GHC.Proof" or the project
                     webpage for more examples and more information.
