synopsis: Installer wrapper for Haskell applications
description:
  This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell module
  during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions
  which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the
  files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar
  files or executable zip or other file archives.
  .
  Note that the current implementation is very inefficient, converting the
  included files as Strings. On any non-trivial sized file, you'll need to
  increase GHC's stack with +RTS -K32M -RTS to avoid stack overflows.
