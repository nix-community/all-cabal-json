synopsis: Installer wrapper for Haskell applications
description:
  This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell module
  during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions
  which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the
  files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar
  files or executable zip or other file archives.
  .
  Note that the current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However,
  either use -fvia-C which will take care of all compilation for you (but
  will be slow) or use -fasm which will probably fail at the linking stage.
  Compile the generated .c files and manually link together to complete the
  installation. On any non-trivial sized file, you may need to increase GHC's
  stack with +RTS -K32M -RTS to avoid stack overflows.
