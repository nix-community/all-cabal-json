synopsis: Installer wrapper for Haskell applications
description:
  This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell module
  during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions
  which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the
  files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar
  files or executable zip or other file archives.
  .
  The current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However, it does
  require that you have a C compiler installed which can be invoked through
  @cc@.
