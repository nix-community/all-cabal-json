Version:                0.1
Synopsis:               Finite state machines and FSM actions
Description:
    This is a library for representing and manipulating finite state
    machines (FSMs) in Haskell, with an emphasis on computing the
    effects of sequences of transitions across entire machines (which
    we call actions), and in particular investigating action
    equivalences between such sequences.
