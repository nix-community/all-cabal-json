Synopsis:       Strict concurrency abstractions
Category:       Control
Description:
        This package provides strict versions of some standard Haskell
        concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which provide control
        over where evaluation takes place not offered by the default
        lazy types. This may be useful for deciding when and where 
        evaluation occurs, leading to improved time or space use,
        depending on the circumstances.
