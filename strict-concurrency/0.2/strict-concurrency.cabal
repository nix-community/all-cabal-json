Synopsis:       Strict concurrency abstractions
Category:       Control
Description:
        This package provides head normal form strict versions of some
        standard Haskell concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which
        provide control over where evaluation takes place not offered by
        the default lazy types. This may be useful for deciding when and
        where evaluation occurs, leading to improved time or space use,
        depending on the circumstances.
