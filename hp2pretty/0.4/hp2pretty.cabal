Name:                hp2pretty
Version:             0.4
Synopsis:            generate pretty graphs from heap profiles
Description:         hp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with
                     the aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and
                     more beautiful output.  Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable
                     Vector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.
                     Also none (count'em) of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in
                     hp2pretty.
                     .
                     Usage has changed since the previous release:
                     .
                        hp2pretty *.hp
                     .
                        hp2pretty --uniform-scale=time   *.hp
                     .
                        hp2pretty --uniform-scale=memory *.hp
                     .
                        hp2pretty --uniform-scale=both   *.hp
                     .
                     Colours have also changed: now they are based on a hash of the
                     cost label, which should make colours have stable semantics
                     across program runs.
