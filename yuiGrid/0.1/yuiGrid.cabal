Name:               yuiGrid
Version:            0.1
Synopsis:           Grids defined by layout hints and implemented on top of Yahoo grids.
Description:        The grid is specified by boxes, containers and hints telling how these boxes and containers should be laid out. The hints also 
                    include CSS specifications. Everything is rendered to html using Yahoo grids through the contextual html combinators
                     (see yahoo grids in  <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids >).
                    The contextual html combinators are also implemented in this package (called CxML here). They allow to keep track of input context 
                    and output html parts like inline CSSs, JSs, etc.
