description:         This library is essentially a reimplementation of the
                     pattern generation algorithm described in
                     Wentlian Li's 1998 article COMPLEX PATTERNS
                     GENERATED BY NEXT NEAREST NEIGHBORDS CELLULAR
                     AUTONOMA (Choas and Fractals: A Computer
                     Graphical Journey). This algorithm allows one to
                     generate an amazing pattern (sometimes with
                     fractal characteristics) by simply specifying a
                     32-bit integer. Please visit the project homepage
                     for more information along with example images.
