synopsis:        Compression and decompression in the bzip2 format
description:     This package provides a pure interface for compressing and 
                 decompressing streams of data represented as lazy 
                 'ByteString's. It uses the bz2 C library so it has high
                 performance.
                 .
                 It provides a convenient high level api suitable for most
                 tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it
                 provides access to the full bzip2 feature set.
