Description:     Online Gibbs sampler for Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 
                 LDA is a generative admixture model frequently used 
                 for topic modeling and other applications. The primary
                 goal of this implementation is to be used for probabilistic 
                 soft word class induction.
                 The sampler can be used in an online as well as batch mode.
