Synopsis:           A monad transformers for multi-prompt delimited control
Description:        This library implements the superset of the interface described in

                    .
                    This library is the most direct implementation of the bubble-up reduction
                    semantics of multi-prompt delimited control. The library stands out in not
                    being based on the continuation monad. Rather, the monad of "Control.Monad.CC.CCExc"
                    is an extension of the 'Error' monad: a monad for restartable exceptions.
                    The library offers not one monad transformer but a family ('CC' 'p')
                    parameterized by the prompt flavor 'p' . The library defines several prompt
                    flavors; the users are welcome to define their own.
                    .
