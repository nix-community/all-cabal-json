synopsis:            Automatically convert Generic instances to and from church representations
description:         This package provides a type to generically construct the type of the church
                     representation.

                     Additionally, it provides a type class @ChurchRep@ which contains
                     a pair of functions for mapping back and forth between the two
                     representations.
                     .
                     Both the type and the @ChurchRep@ instance are be automatically constructed
                     for all types with a @Generic@ instance.
