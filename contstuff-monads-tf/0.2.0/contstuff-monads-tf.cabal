Description:

    This package provides contstuff transformer class instances for the
    monad transformers from the monads-tf package as well as monads-tf
    transformer class instances for the monad transformers from
    contstuff.  This makes using both transformer libraries in a single
    project much more convenient as you get along with a single set of
    lifting functions.
