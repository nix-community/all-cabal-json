Synopsis:       Compositional lazy dataflow networks for exact real number computation
Tested-with:    GHC ==6.10.1
Description:
    AERN-Net provides
    datatypes and abstractions for defining and executing
    networks of communicating processes.  These networks have a fixed
    topology, which can be infinite via recursion.
    The communication on each channel is driven by
    some query-response protocol.  Basic protocols
    for communicating approximations of real numbers and
    functions are provided together with protocol combinators
    eg for communicating value pairs or lists
    and communicating with additional query parameters
    or with optimised repetitions.
    .
    An class-based abstraction is provided to make it possible
    to execute networks on various distributed backends without modification.
    At the moment there is only one backend, which is not distributed.
    It is envisaged that truly distributed backends will be added soon,
    eg based on plain TCP, MPI or REST/SOAP Web services.
    .
    A mathematical foundation of these networks is described
    in the draft
    paper <http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~konecnym/papers/ernets08-draft.html>.
    .
    Simple examples of usage can be found in modules @DemoMax@ and @DemoSqrt@ 
    in folder @examples@.
