description:         Access package information from Arch Linux's AUR via its
                     RPC interface. The main exposed functions reflect
                     those of the RPC:
                     .
                     * info:      Get metadata for one package.
                     .
                     * multiinfo: Get metadata for many packages at once.
                     .
                     * search:    Get limited metadata for packages that
                                  match a given regex.
                     .
                     * msearch:   Get metadata for all packages maintained
                                  by a given user.
                     .
                     By default this library supports version 3 of the RPC,
                     and hence version 3.2+ of the AUR.
