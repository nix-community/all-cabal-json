name:                aur

version:             0.0.1

synopsis:            Access metadata from the Arch Linux User Repository.

description:         Access package information from Arch Linux's AUR via its
                     RPC interface. The main exposed functions reflect
                     those of the RPC:
                     - info:      Get metadata for one package.
                     - multiinfo: Get metadata for many packages at once.
                     - search:    Get limited metadata for packages that
                                  match a given regex.
                     - msearch:   Get metadata for all packages maintained
                                  by a given user.
                     By default this library supports version 2 of the RPC,
                     and hence version 3.x of the AUR.
