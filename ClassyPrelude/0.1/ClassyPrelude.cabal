Name:                ClassyPrelude
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Prelude replacement using classes instead of concrete types where reasonable
Description:         ClassyPrelude is a Prelude for people who know Haskell well. It
                     re-exports some commonly imported modules, replaces Prelude
                     functions with their type-class equivalents where reasonable, and
                     removes some Prelude functions that in my opinion don't belong
                     there.

                     These modules are likely to be incomplete. Suggestions are greatly appreciated.
