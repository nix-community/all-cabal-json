Synopsis:               HFuse is a binding for the Linux FUSE library
Description:            HFuse is a binding to the Linux C library, FUSE ('Filesystems in Userspace');
                        FUSE allows you to construct interesting filesystems which can be used in many ways,
                        such as a filesystem in which the files are Wikipedia files, or SSHFS where one mounts remote
                        directories over SSH, or FlickrFS which represents your Flickr account as directories and files.
