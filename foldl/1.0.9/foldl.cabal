Synopsis: Composable, streaming, and efficient left folds
Description: This library provides strict left folds that stream in constant
  memory, and you can combine folds using @Applicative@ style to derive new
  folds.  Derived folds still traverse the container just once and are often as
  efficient as hand-written folds.
