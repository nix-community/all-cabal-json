synopsis:            Visualisation of Strange Attractors in 3-Dimensions
description:         This software uses innovative techniques to achieve 3-D visualisation
		     of the point sets known as Strange Attractors resulting from iteration
		     of non-linear maps on points in Euclidean Space. Version 0.1.3 requires new
      		     versions of OpenGL and GLUT libraries. Use version 0.1.2 is you have
		     old OpenGL and GLUT and don't want to upgrade.
