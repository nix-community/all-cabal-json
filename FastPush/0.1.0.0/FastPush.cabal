name:                FastPush
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A monad and monad transformer for pushing things onto a stack very fast.
description:         This library gives you a monad that lets you push things onto a stack very quickly. 
                     You get things off the stack when you run the monad. Under the hood, this uses mutable
                     vectors. I've also included a monad transformer using the STMonadTrans library that 
                     does the same thing as a transformer, but it's probably very unsafe.
