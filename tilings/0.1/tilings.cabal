Synopsis:            substitution tilings
Description:
    Substitution tilings.  The term substitution, in connection with tilings,
    describes a simple but powerful method to produce tilings with many
    interesting properties.
    .
    The main idea is to use a finite set of building blocks called prototiles,
    an expanding linear map (the inflation factor), and a rule how to dissect
    each scaled tile into copies of the original prototiles.
    .
    For some examples of substitution tilings, and a glossary of terminology,
    see the /tilings encyclopedia/
