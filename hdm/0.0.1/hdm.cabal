Name: hdm
Version: 0.0.1
Synopsis: a small display manager.
Description: A small display manager which loads from shell and just provides a text based menu for selecting the xinitrc file of your choice.  I created it for use with xmonad, where I often wish to start up gnome or xfce4 as well.  Since this uses startx, it handles multiple xsessions seamlessly.
