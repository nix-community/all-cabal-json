synopsis:       A implementation of a type-checker for Lambda-H
description:    We have made an implementation of the language Lambda-H,
                described in the paper "Hybrid Type Checking" by Cormac Flanagan, which uses a
                hybrid type checking system.
                We have tried to keep our implementation as close as possible to the language
                defined in Flanagan's paper. The result should be seen as a proof-of-concept,
                and an exercise in implementing a hybrid type checker for a language with
                advanced type specifications.
