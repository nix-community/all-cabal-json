Synopsis:            Library for incremental computing.

Description:         This is a Haskell (plus some extensions) implementation
                     of a library for incremental computing.  It closely
                     follows the implementation in the nice POPL 2002 paper
                     "Adaptive Functional Programming", by Umut Acar,
                     Guy Blelloch and Bob Harper.
