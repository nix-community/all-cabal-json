Synopsis:            Library for incremental computing.
Description:         This is a Haskell (plus some extensions) implementation 
		     of a library for incremental computing.  It closely 
		     follows the implementation in the nice POPL 2002 paper 
		     "Adaptive Functional Programming", by Umut Acar, 
		     Guy Blelloch and Bob Harper.
