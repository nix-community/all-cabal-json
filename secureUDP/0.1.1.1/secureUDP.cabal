name:                secureUDP
version:             0.1.1.1
synopsis:            Setups secure (unsorted) UDP packet transfer.
description:
    This simple module allows to send packages ensuring delivering over an UDP connection
    using ACKs and timeouts under the hood, also setups the threads needed for listening
    and sending, making them transparent to the user.
    .
    As the packages can be delivered just when they arrive, is not guarenteed that
    they arrive in order.
    .
    Once a sent package has passed many timeouts without been ACKed from the recipient it
    can be recognized as a lost package, meaning that the recipient cannot longer be
    reached.
