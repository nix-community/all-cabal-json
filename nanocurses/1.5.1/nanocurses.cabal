synopsis:            Simple Curses binding
description:         This is a simple binding to the Curses library, a common
                     Unix library which allows you to use a terminal as a
                     canvas on which your paint are characters (instead of line
                     by line output); Curses is probably most useful for rogue-like
                     interfaces.
                     .
                     Nanocurses differs from Hscurses and Mage in that it is
                     intended to be portable to Curses libraries other than Ncurses, such
                     as Ocurses, Irix's curses, and so on. So it may not have all their features.
                     (It does not differ significantly from Hmp3's Curses binding, as the Curses.hsc
                     in Nanocurses is essentially extracted from Hmp3.)
