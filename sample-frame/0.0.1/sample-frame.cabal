Synopsis:         Handling of samples in an (audio) signal
Description:
   This package provides a type class
   to handle signed and unsigned samples
   of various size and number of channels in a uniform way.
   .
   We expect that you use the types Int8, Word8 and so on
   for monophonic samples and thus provide instances of the class for them.
   Further we define Stereo record and mu-law sample type.
   Quadrophony can be achieved by nested Stereo value,
   but I'm uncertain, whether this is a good way to go.
   Maybe we add 5+1 channels or so in future.
   .
   This is used by packages sox, alsa, synthesizer.
