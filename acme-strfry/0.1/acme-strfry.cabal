name:                acme-strfry
version:             0.1
synopsis:            A binding to the glibc strfry function.
description:
  This library provides a simple interface to the glibc @strfry@
  function, addressing the perennial programming quandary: \"How do I
  take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?\"
  .
  For more information, consult the glibc documentation:
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/strfry.html>
  .
  Both @String@ and @ByteString@ interfaces are offered, as well as
  the raw FFI binding.
