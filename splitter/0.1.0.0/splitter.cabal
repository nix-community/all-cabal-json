Name:                splitter
Version:             0.1.0.0

Synopsis:            Use numerical ranges to split out certain lines from a file.

Description:         
   Splitter lets you specify numerical ranges to split out certain lines
   from a file. This means that you can extract exactly what you want from a file and only
   the sections that you want. Or, if you are only interested in a log file after a certain
   preamble then you can specify that range of files too.
