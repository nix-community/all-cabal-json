name:                rewrite
version:             0.10
synopsis:            open file and rewrite it with new contents
description:
  In the Unix shell there is no easy way to use a filter program
  to change the contents of a file in-place. For example, if you
  want to sort a file in place, this will not work:
  .
  sort \< myfile \> myfile
  .
  All that will get you is an empty myfile. This package
  gives you the rewrite program, so this will work:
  .
  rewrite myfile sort
