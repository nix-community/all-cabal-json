description:  This library defines a set of type classes for generic
    time arithmetic.  It supports universal time types like @UTCTime@
    from the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time time library> as
    well as physical time types like the ones from
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clock clock>.
