Description:         While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself
		     having to make FFI calls to @select(2)@. This package provides an interface to that system call.
		     .
		     Changed in version 0.4.0.1:
		     .
		     * Minor internal cleanups.
		     .
		     * TODO moved to file.
		     .
		     Changes in version 0.4:
		     .
		     * Introduce an interface to @fd_set@.
		     .
		     * Add functions with various amounts of abstraction; in particular, 'select'''
		      matches 'select' in previous versions.
		     .
		     * Retry @select(2)@ in case of interruption by signals.
		     .
		     * Remove dependence on the vector package.
		     .
		     WARNINGS:
		     .
		     * Behavior with write and exception file descriptors is under-tested. 
		       Feedback is welcome.
		     .
		     * This package is far from complete, and should be tested throughly before being relied upon.
		     .
		     /NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name
		     like select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if someone more qualified wants
		     to use this package name. Let me know.
