Description:         While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself
		     having to make FFI calls to @select(2)@. This package provides an interface to that system call.
		     It also used to expose an STM interface for running @select(2)@ with alternative STM actions,
		     but that functionality was split into the stm-orelse-io package from version 0.3.
		     .
		     Changes in version 0.3:
		     .
		     * Split all STM-related functionality into a separate package, stm-orelse-io, independent
		       of select.
		     .
		     TODO:
		     .
		     * Provide a type for @fd_set@ that can be passed to and from C so that we can have a version 
		     of 'System.Posix.IO.select' that reports /which/ file descriptors are ready, instead of how many.
 		     Its type will be something like @[Fd] -> [Fd] -> [Fd] -> Timeout -> IO ([Fd], [Fd], [Fd])@.
		     .
		     /NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name
		     like select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if anybody else wants
		     to use this package name. Let me know.
