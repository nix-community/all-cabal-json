-- A longer description of the package.
description: 
 The maximum entropy method, or MAXENT, is variational approach for computing probability 
 distributions given a list of moment, or expected value, constraints.
 .
 Here are some links for background info.
 .
 A good overview of applications:
 <http://cmm.cit.nih.gov/maxent/letsgo.html>
 .
 On the idea of maximum entropy in general: 
 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy>
 .
 Use this package to compute discrete maximum entropy distributions over a list of values and
 list of constraints.
 .
 Here is a the example from Probability the Logic of Science
 .
 @
  maxent ([1,2,3], [average 1.5])
 @
 .
 Right [0.61, 0.26, 0.11]
 .
 The classic dice example
 .
 @
  maxent ([1,2,3,4,5,6], [average 4.5])
 @
 .
 Right [.05, .07, 0.11, 0.16, 0.23, 0.34]
 .
 One can use different constraints besides the average value there.  
 .
 As for why you want to maximize the entropy to find the probability constraint, 
 I will say this for now. In the case of the average constraint 
 it is a kin to choosing a integer partition with the most interger compositions. 
 I doubt that makes any sense, but I will try to explain more with a blog post soon.
