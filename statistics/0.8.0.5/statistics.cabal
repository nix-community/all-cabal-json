version:        0.8.0.5
x-revision: 1
synopsis:       A library of statistical types, data, and functions
description:
  This library provides a number of common functions and types useful
  in statistics.  Our focus is on high performance, numerical
  robustness, and use of good algorithms.  Where possible, we provide
  references to the statistical literature.
  .
  The library's facilities can be divided into four broad categories:
  .
  Working with widely used discrete and continuous probability
  distributions.  (There are dozens of exotic distributions in use; we
  focus on the most common.)
  .
  Computing with sample data: quantile estimation, kernel density
  estimation, bootstrap methods, signigicance testing, and autocorrelation
  analysis.
  .
  Random variate generation under several different distributions.
  .
  Common statistical tests for significant differences between samples.
