description:
  This library is a solution for http-based routing and dispatch. It's
  goals are similar to the goals of `servant`. However, `trasa` relies
  on very different mechanisms to accomplish this. There are no typeclasses
  in this library, and there is a single closed type family that is provided
  as a convenience. All of the real work is accomplish with GADTs, 
  universal quantification, and plain old haskell data types.
