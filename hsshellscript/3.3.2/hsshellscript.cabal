Synopsis:            Haskell for Unix shell scripting tasks
Description:         A Haskell-library for tasks which are usually done in
                     shell scripts. This includes parsing command line
                     arguments; dealing with paths; some commands for dealing
                     with files; calling external programs and subroutines as
                     separate processes; pipes and redirection of input and
                     output; and error handling.
