Synopsis:	A perfect hashing library for mapping bytestrings to values.
Description:    A perfect hashing library for mapping bytestrings to values.
		Insertion is not supported (by design): this is just a binding
		to the C-based CMPH library (http://cmph.sf.net). Only fromList
		and lookup operations are supported, but in many circumstances
		this is all that's required.
