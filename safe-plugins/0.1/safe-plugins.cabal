Name:                safe-plugins
Version:             0.1

Synopsis:            A small wrapper over hs-plugins to allow loading safe plugins

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         This library allows you to load plugins, just as hs-plugins do.
                     But under some circumstances, you do not want to allow
                     plugins to do everything they want. What about plugin
                     which executes `rm -rf /*' ? In Haskell, you can limit
                     plugin's abilities just by not allowing it to import `not
                     safe' modules (System.IO.Unsafe, etc). With this library,
                     you specify a list of modules that plugin should be forced
                     to import (i.e., some plugin API module), and a list of
                     module that you want to allow plugin to import (some
                     `surely safe' modules). Plugin cannot import any other
                     modules. Moreover, you can specify some language
                     extensions, for example, NoImplicitPrelude.
