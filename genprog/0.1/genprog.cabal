Description:
  This package provides a /genetic programming/ framework. Genetic
  programming is an evolutionary technique, inspired by biological
  evolution, to evolve programs for solving specific problems. A genetic
  program is represented by a value of an algebraic datatype and
  associated with a custom-defined /fitness/ value indicating the quality
  of the solution. Starting from a randomly generated initial population
  of genetic programs, the genetic operators of /selection/, /crossover/,
  and /mutation/ are used to evolve programs of increasingly better
  quality.
