Synopsis:            Serialization library using Data.Generics
Description:         GenericSerialize is a library for serialization using the
                     existing generic-programming framework.
                     .
                     It is often advocated that support for serialization should be added to
                     the compiler (e.g. in the form of a deriving(Binary)).  With this I
                     intend to show that the existing infrastructure is sufficient, and
                     has some advantages over a dedicated serialization interface.
                     .
                     The main advantage that generic serialization posseses is that it is
                     possible to simultaneously have several serialization modes.  While
                     interfaces such as AltBinary allow writing to any type of stream, the
                     data format is fixed.  By contrast, GenericSerialize supports multiple
                     serialization modes; while the only currently existing module is for a
                     subset of R5RS s-expressions, that module is less than 100 lines of code
                     and is almost pure grammar.
