description:         

 This package provides high-level Haskell bindings for the well-known
 MiniSat satisfiability solver. It solves the boolean satisfiability
 problem, i.e., the input is a boolean formula, and the output is a
 list of all satisfying assignments.

 MiniSat is a fully automated, well-optimized general-purpose SAT
 solver written by Niklas Een and Niklas Sorensson, and further
 modified by Takahisa Toda.

 Unlike other similar Haskell packages, we provide a convenient
 high-level interface to the SAT solver, hiding the complexity of the
 underlying C implementation. It can be easily integrated into other
 programs as an efficient turn-key solution to many search problems.

 To illustrate the use of the library, two example programs are
 included in the "examples" directory; one program solves Sudoku
 puzzles, and the other solves a 3-dimensional block packing
 problem. These programs can be built manually, or by invoking Cabal
 with the '--enable-benchmarks' option.
