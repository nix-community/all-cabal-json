name:                amazon-emailer
version:             0.3.0.0
synopsis:            A queue daemon for working with Amazon's Simple Email Service with a
                     PostgreSQL table as a queue.
description:         This application checks every second for messages in a queue table,
                     if there exist some that haven't been sent, it grabs
                     a specified number out (based on what your current send rate is), sends them,
                     marks them as sent, and goes back to sleep.
