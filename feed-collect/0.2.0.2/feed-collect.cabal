name:                feed-collect
version:             0.2.0.2
synopsis:            Watch RSS/Atom feeds (and do with them whatever you like).
description:
  RSS and Atom are common technologies for publishing news updates and watching
  then on the client side. Client programs do a variety of things with them:
  Display feed items for a human user to read, send them into IRC, convert them
  to e-mail messages, aggregate them into larger feeds ("planet"s) and so on.
  .
  This package tries to provide a generic API for handling a stream of news
  items, not tied to any specific use case.
  .
  Using the library you can launch a thread which collects news items, and
  handles them using a custom action you provide. Expected usage in many cases
  is to push items (or specific parts of them) into a 'Chan', and have your
  application's event loop thread do the actual logic.
  .
  Some related packages which make specific uses of feeds are @imm@ and
  @rss2irc@. These 2 packages have inspired some ideas here.
