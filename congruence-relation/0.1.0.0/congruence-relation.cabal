synopsis:            Decidable congruence relations for Haskell: up to you whether this is a joke
description:         The laws of 'Eq' only require that you have a decidable equivalence relation defined on a type; they do not force you to guarantee abstraction with respect to the relation, i.e. you can write anti-extensional operations without violating the laws. This package provides an alternative for when functionality with respect to an equivalence relation is desired.
