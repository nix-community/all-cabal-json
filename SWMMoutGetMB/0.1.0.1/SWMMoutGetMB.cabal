synopsis:            A parser for SWMM 5 binary .OUT files

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water
                     Management Model (SWMM) is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water
                     quality simulation model for single event or long-term (continuous)
                     simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas.

                     SWMM 5, which is currently the newest version of SWMM, produces a
                     binary .OUT file as its output.  SWMMoutGetMB is a SWMM binary
                     reader using the Get monad in Haskell to retrieve contents of this
                     binary file and save it into a SWMMObject, which can then be
                     used in Haskell programs.
