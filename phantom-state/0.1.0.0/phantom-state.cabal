version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Phantom State Monad Transformer. Like State Monad, but without values.
description:         A monad transformer that mimics the State Monad Transformer from the
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers transformers> package,
                     but dropping the values. In those cases that you want to use the State
                     Monad but you only care about how the state changes, use this library
                     to earn a plus of efficiency.
