name:                rainbow
version:             0.4.0.0
synopsis:            Print text to terminal with colors and effects
description:
  rainbow helps you print Text chunks to a terminal with colors and effects
  such as bold, underlining, etc. You pair each Text with a description
  of how it should appear. Rainbow works with both 8-color and 256-color
  terminals.

  .

  rainbow uses the terminfo package which, in turn, needs the full C
  library for ncurses installed, including the development
  headers. Before installing terminfo, you may need to install the
  ncurses headers (for instance, on Debian systems, install the
  libncurses5-dev package.)
