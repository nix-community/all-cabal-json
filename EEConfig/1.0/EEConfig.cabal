description:     Implementation of a very simple parser for parameters recognition.
                  It recognizes given parameters and their values.
                  As input it becomes list of parameters and all their possible values in format [ParameterInput]
                  and input String where parameters will be searched for.
                  As output it deliveres recognized parameters and their values in format [ParameterOutput],
                  where only these parameters are present which have been found in the input string.
                  In output list each exisitng parameter has exactly one value - this one that has
                  been recognized in the input string.
                  Parameters in the input string have to be always given in following format:
                  (\<flagname> \<parameter>)*.
                  Anything what is not recognized as parameter or value is ignored.
