name:                reify
version:             0.1.1
synopsis:            Serialize data
description:         This is a library for reifying Haskell data structures in GHC.

                     Haskell values are mapped into representations that we call
                     graphs (for want of a better name). The representations are
                     encoded in the Haskell type Graph, which is just an ordinary
                     algebraic data type. This will not reify functions.
                     .
