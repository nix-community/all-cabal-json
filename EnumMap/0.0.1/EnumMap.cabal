synopsis: More general IntMap replacement.
description: A version of IntMap that uses the Enum typeclass instead of Int. This is
             very nearly a direct copy of the IntMap package by Daan Leijen and
             Andriy Palamarchuk. The only change is coercing the package to accept
             anything with the Enum class constraint instead of forcing Int's.
