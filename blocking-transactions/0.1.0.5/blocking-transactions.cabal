Version:             0.1.0.5

Synopsis:            Composable, blocking transactions.

Description:         A variable type (BVar), monad (BTM), and arrow
                     (BTA), which provide fast, atomic, composable, blocking
                     inter-thread communication.  Blocking transactions are
                     strictly less expressive than software transactional
                     memory, but may be more efficient under very high
                     contention.
