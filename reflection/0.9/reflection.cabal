description:
  This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
  \"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov and
  Chung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been modified to use @Rank2Types@ and @TypeFamilies@ and
  the implementation has been streamlined to improve performance.

  .
  /Changes in 0.9/:
  .
  * Faster internal implementation.
  .
  * Removed @ReifiedNum@, @reflectNum@, and @reifyIntegral@; @reify@ and @reflect@ are
    considerably faster than the special case combinators were.
  .
  /Changes in 0.8/:
  .
  * Switched to using type families to avoid a problem where the user could cast
    @Proxy (s a) -> Proxy (s b)@ and get back a values with the wrong type under
    the API in effect from 0.6. This API yields a much nicer example as well.
  .
  * Removed @reflectT@ as it no longer makes sense.
  .
  * Added a more advanced example @example/Constraints.hs@ using constraint kinds.
  .
  /Changes in 0.7/:
  .
  * Uses a much simpler construction where @reify@ now converts a @StablePtr@ to an
    @IntPtr@ and reifies that directly as an integral type rather than serializing
    and storing the StablePtr as a list of bytes as proposed in the original paper.
  .
  * Removed @ReifiedStorable@ and @ReifiedNums@.
  .
  * Since we have so many fewer classes now, @Data.Reflection.Internal@ was merged back
    into @Data.Reflection@
  .
  /Changes in 0.6/:
  .
  * Removed the dependency on multiparameter type classes, functional
    dependencies, and flexible instances, by making @Reifies@ a single
    parameter type class in the same fashion as @ReifiesStorable@.
  .
  * Moved the building blocks to @Data.Reflection.Internal@ to reduce API clutter.
  .
  * Added @reflectT@
  .
  /Changes in 0.5/:
  .
  * Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type
    with kind @* -> *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type
    argument rather than just a @Proxy@.
  .
  /Changes in 0.4/:
  .
  * Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This
    reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user
    code.
