Name:                 Pathfinder
Version:              0.5.3
Synopsis:             Relational optimiser and code generator
Description:
  The library provides FFI bindings to the Pathfinder relational optimiser and
  code generator. Specifically, the library allows for
  .
  * optimisation of table algebra (a variant of relational algebra) expressions
  .
  * and compilation of table algebra expressions into SQL:1999 queries
  .
  Note that the C source bundle of Pathfinder is also included in this
  package. The C sources are automatically built along with the Haskell FFI
  bindings. There is no need to download and install Pathfinder separately.
  .
