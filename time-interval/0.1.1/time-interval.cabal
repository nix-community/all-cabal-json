version:             0.1.1
synopsis:            Use a time unit class, but hold a concrete time type.
description:
  Two common ways to represent and hold short time intervals seem to be:
  .
  1. Hold time in microseconds as an 'Int' or 'Integer'
  .
  2. Use time units abstraction, e.g. see the time-units package
  .
  While the second option is a great abstraction to use in APIs, it works for
  datatypes a bit less well than for function types. That's because a datatype
  which a 'Data.Time.Units.TimeUnit' field suddenly becomes polymorphic over
  that field, and all function type signatures involving that datatype need to
  be updated. This is less an issue for functions, because you don't specify
  the type of every function at the call site.
  .
  Perhaps there is a solution for that which involves datatype related
  language extensions, but this package tries to offer a simple clean solution
  as follows. You store time in your datatype as an integer, but it is wrapped
  by an opaque 'Data.Time.Interval.TimeInterval' type. You then get the best of
  both worlds:
  .
  * On one hand, you can set the time field using any time unit thanks to the
    time-units package, so you get a nice abstraction
  .
  * On the other hand, your datatype holds a concrete time type
  .
  The time type can be equally used to represent time intervals, time durations
  and generally time lengths. But since high precision is used (microseconds),
  you'll probably want this library for short time lengths (at most seconds,
  minutes, hours). For calendar based and related time functions and types, see
  the @time@ package.
