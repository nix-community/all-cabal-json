Synopsis:        Template code for an app using GTK, Glade and Cairo graphics
Description:     This is a template for building new GUI applications. The
                 GTK widget layout is done via a Glade XML file which can be
                 edited visually using glade.

                 This template includes working callbacks to handle the File
                 and Help menus and File Save/Open dialogs, with dummy
                 handlers for selecting filenames and the Edit menu's
                 cut/copy/paste.

                 The main canvas for this application uses Cairo for
                 graphics rendering, and includes example code from the
                 cairo package.
