name:          cabalvchk
version:       0.3
synopsis:      Verify installed package version against user-specified constraints.

description:

  This utility can be used to verify the version of an installed
  package against version constraints.  The version constraints can
  be specified in typical cabal fashion (e.g. >= 8.3, == 0.9.*, >= 8.3 && < 9.0).
  .
  Usage: cabalvchk package-name version-constraints [verbose]
  .
  Note that the version-constraints will probably need to be enclosed in
  single-quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting characters in the
  specification.
  .
  One use of this utility is by external configuration/validation utilities
  (e.g. autoconf) to verify installed package versions without running a
  cabal build.  This utility produces no output (unless a third argument is
  specified) and the return value is 0 if the constraints are met or non-zero
  if the constraints are not met (including if the package is not installed).
  .
  Changes in 0.3:
  .
  * Changed category to Distribution
  .
  * Only consider exposed packages
  .
  Changes in 0.2:
  .
  * Handles multiple package installations by returning 0 if any of the
    installed versions satisfies the constraints.
