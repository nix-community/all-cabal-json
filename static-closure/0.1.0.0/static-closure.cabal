name:           static-closure
version:        0.1.0.0
synopsis:       Serialisable static pointers to functions
description:    A more generalised and expanded version of the ideas found in [distributed-closure](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/distributed-closure) in the following ways:-
                .
                1. This library allows for the core serialisable type to any type, although we currently only implement \"Binary\".
                .
                2. Template Haskell is used to implement dictionary instances for all instances of \"Binary\" in all packages shipped with GHC with the assistance of [ghc-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-instances).
                .
                This library is very much a work in progress. It is largely untested except to check it compiles. Future tasks to do include:-
                .
                1. Writing some test cases to make sure this actually works.
                .
                2. Integrating with [freelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freelude), the restricted \"pure\" function is perfect to define in \"freelude\".
                .
                3. Writing some more Template Haskell functions to allow easy integration with user defined types.
                .
                4. Linking this up with [acid-state](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acid-state) in a somewhat sensible way.
