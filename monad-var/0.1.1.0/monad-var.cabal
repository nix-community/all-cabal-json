name:                monad-var
version:             0.1.1.0
synopsis:            Generic operations over variables
description:         The aim of this library is to provide a unified set of operations (@new@, @read@, @write@, @swap@, various strict @mutate*@ functions and their derivatives (like mutate-and-return-the-old-value) and a certain interface for @MVar@-like things) over all common variable types: @IORef@, @STRef s@, @MVar@, @TVar@, @TMVar@.
                     When possible type classes are generalized to be over abstract containers rather than variables: e.g. it'd make sense to implement `MonadRead TChan` and `MonadMutate_ Vector` instances, but no such instances are provided right now.
                     There are also some lenses to be described in an upcoming blog post.
