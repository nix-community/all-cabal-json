description:                    

 The package consists of two command-line utilities to manage the /Asus WL500g Premium/
 router without logging to its admin page.
 .
 The main utility is @WL500gPControl@ is used to ask the status of the connection 
 (@Connected@/@Disconnected@), connection parameters (@DNS servers@, @Local IP@, 
 @Foreign IP@ etc, log), and perform connection, disconnection and reconnection.
 .
 Other utility - @WL500gPStatus@ created only to ease integration into <xmobar> 
 and return only @Connected@ or @Disconnected@ string, enclosed into format 
 tags (when option @-c@ is given).
 .
 The last argument of these two utilities is a credentials file. It has simple format:
 .
 @

        user: \<user name\>
        password: \<password\>
        host: \<host name or IP address\>

 @ 
 .
 The password should be in plain text, so it is recommended to protect this 
 file from reading for everyone except you.
 .
 If credentials file is not given, than programs will try to use default 
 credential file, which should be located:
 .
 * on Linux: @$HOME\/.WL500gPControl\/credentials@
 . 
 * on Windows: @C\:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\WL500gPControl\\credentials@
 .
 Sometimes paths could be different. To determine the read path to the 
 default credentials file run @WL500gPControl -s@ and look at the error string, where
 will be sayed where it searches credentials file.
