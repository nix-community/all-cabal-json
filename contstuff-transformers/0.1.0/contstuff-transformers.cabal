Description:

    This package provides contstuff transformer class instances for the
    monad transformers from the transformers package as well as
    transformers class instances for the monad transformers from
    contstuff.  This makes using both transformer libraries in a single
    project much more convenient as you get along with a single set of
    lifting functions.
