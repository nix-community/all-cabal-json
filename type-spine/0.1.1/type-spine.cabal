Synopsis:       A spine-view on types

Description: Until

  reaches the mainline, this is a surprisingly effective workaround. We support
  a limited number of kinds out-of-the-box, but it can be extended by the
  power-user. Also, quasiquotation makes the code rather legible. Given a
  finite set of kinds to support, generic type families can be defined that
  will work for an infinite number of types. It is very much a \"bumping up\"
  of the term-level /spine view/.
