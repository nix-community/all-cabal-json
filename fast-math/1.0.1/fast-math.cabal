synopsis:       Non IEEE-754 compliant compile-time floating-point optimisations
description:
    The "Numeric.FastMath" module brings into scope many unsafe @RULES@ for 
    'Float's and 'Double's that can greatly improve run time performance.
    It is roughly equivalent to gcc\'s @-ffast-math@ compiler flag.
    Optimisation (at least @-O1@) must be enabled for any @RULES@ to take effect.
    .
    These rules are unsafe because they don't strictly adhere to the
    IEEE-754 regulations and may subtly change the results of your numeric computations.
    See the <http://github.com/liyang/fast-math/ README> on github for more details.
