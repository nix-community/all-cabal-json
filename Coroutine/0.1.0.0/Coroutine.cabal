synopsis:        Type-safe coroutines using lightweight session types.
description:     This package provides a pure interface for composing
                 independent functions that have a well-defined
                 communication protocol.
                 It is loosely based on Jesse Tov's Haskell Symposium 2008
                 paper "Haskell Session Types with (almost) no class"
