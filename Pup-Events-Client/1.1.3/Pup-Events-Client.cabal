synopsis:               A networked event handling framework for hooking
                        into other programs.
description:            Pup-Events is a networking enabled event handling
                        framework. This package contains the Client
                        component. In order for the client to be useful it
                        needs events and associated handlers, which you
                        write. You then call the `client` function, passing
                        in the required functions for the client to work
                        properly.
                        properly.
