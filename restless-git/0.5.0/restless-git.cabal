description:
  This package defines a simple way to serialize state as a nested file
  hierarchy saved in a Git repository.

  It is still quite inflexible, and rather slow because it repeatedly
  invokes Git's plumbing commands.

  It used to be implemented with libgit2, but I found it desirable to
  avoid FFI.

  Any way to make it faster without FFI would be great.
