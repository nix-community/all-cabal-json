description:
        This is an initial implementation of a socket multiplexer\/demultiplexer to tunnel Unix domain sockets over pipes\/streams.
        .
        The primary envisioned use is to tunnel Unix domain sockets over SSH like so:
        .
        > mkfifo /tmp/sockin
        > ssh user@host socket2stream -l /path/to/remotesocket < /tmp/sockin | socket2stream -r /path/to/localsocket > /tmp/sockin
