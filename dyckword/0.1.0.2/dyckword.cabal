name:                dyckword
version:             0.1.0.2
synopsis:            A library for working with binary Dyck words.
description:
    The binary Dyck language consists of all strings of evenly balanced left 
    and right parentheses, brackets, or some other symbols, together with the 
    /empty/ word. Words in this language are known as /Dyck words/, some 
    examples of which are @()()()@, @(())((()))@, and @((()()))()@.
    .
    The counting sequence associated with the Dyck language is the 
    /Catalan numbers/, who describe properties of a great number of 
    combinatorial objects.
