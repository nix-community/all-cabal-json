description:
  .
  A library to produce /microprints/ [1] sometimes known as 
  \"greek-text\". 
  .
  Note this library only provides the graphically half of the 
  functionality needed to make microprints. There is no support 
  for tokenizing input files, and at the moment it is really 
  just a test bed for Wumpus.
  .
  Currently pictures are made within a monad providing /teletype/ 
  style operations. Other methods of drawing are possible, but 
  are yet to be implemented.
  .
