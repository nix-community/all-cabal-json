synopsis: A Transactional cache with user-defined persistence
description: TCache is a transactional cache with configurable persitence. It allows conventional
             STM transactions for objects that syncronize  with their user-defined storages.
             State in memory and into permanent storage is transactionally coherent.
             .
             It has interface defined for Amazon WS and Yesod Persistent backends defined in tcache-<backend>
             packages.
             Persistent is a multi-backend interface for SQL and non SQL databases such in Mongo-db
             .
             The package implements serializable STM references, access by key and by record field value, triggers,
             full text and field indexation, default serialization and a query language based on record fields
             .
             Since the STM references can be included in data structures and serialized, this is right
             for graph databases and other NoSQL databases.
             .
             0.12.0 space in index data in indexQuery.hs and IndexText.hs triggered errors in the AWS backend.
             The space has been changed by '-'. So rename the "index *" files in the TCache folder
             in order to be recognized.
             .
             0.11.0.0 added setIndexParsist to define persistence for indexes by type. started the addition of readDBRefs, readResources and so on for simultaneous read, writes and deletes of
             objects of the same type.
             .
             0.10.2.0 Added setDefaultPersist and modified the signature of setPersist in Data.TCache.DefaultPersistence.
             Fixed issues with ghc 7.6.3
             .
             0.10  version add memoization and a persistent and transactional collection/queue.
             .
             0.10.0.8 subversion add cachedByKeySTM
             .
             0.10.0.9 fixed an error in clearSyncChacheProc and SynWrite Asyncronous that checked the cache continuously
             .
             See "Data.TCache" for details
             .
             In this release:
             .
             Dropped Data.Hashtable (deprecated). Now it uses the package hashtables
