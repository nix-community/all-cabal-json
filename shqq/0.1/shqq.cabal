description:
    This library provides a quasiquoter for executing shell commands, somewhat
    similar to Perl's backtick operator.  Shell commands are IO actions, and
    they capture the command's standard output as a @String@ result.
    .
    You can use Haskell variables in a shell command.  A string representation
    of the contents will be interpolated.  The shell will see each interpolated
    variable as a single token without interpreting special characters, unless
    you choose otherwise.
    .
    Note: The shell escaping is not correct for the Windows shell.  This library
    should fail to build on Windows, as well.
    .
    Examples of using this library are included in @examples/@.

-- Our shell escaping is not correct on Windows.  We make the project Unix-only
-- in two ways: the 'unix' dependency, and a CPP macro check in ShQQ.hs.
