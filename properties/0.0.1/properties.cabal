description:         Test.Properties is flexible and readable way of codifing and executing assertions.
                     The properties can be defined right within the class or the code for which the
                     properties apply.
                     .
                     Instead of testing properties with automatically generate values in a separate
                     test program,this package permits to test them on the fly while the real application run,
                     with the data produced within. So somehow unites the readability of
                     QuickCheck and the flexibility of assert.  It is simple and straighforward
                     But is by no means perfect. no statistics and so on. Just trace messages are
                     created.
                     .
                     The primary purpose of this package was to define class properties
                     and to check their instances. The properties can be defined within a class.
                     so no additional exports are necessary. checking instaces can be done within
                     the instance declarations. But it can be used anywhere assertions
                     are used. It can be attached to arbitrary piece of code for whick
                     the property group holds.
                     .
                     The package includes  complete examples.
