Name:                typesafe-endian
Version:             0.1.0.1
Category:            Data
Stability:           experimental
Synopsis:            Enforce endianness with types
Description:
  This package provides newtype wrappers for separating data with specified
  endianness from other data of the same type with normal, system-specific
  endianness. Since these wrappers are newtypes, no runtime overhead is
  incurred.

  Currently the underlying 'EndianSensitive' typeclass its instances are taken
  directly from the 'data-endian' package. However, if Haskell or GHC ever gets
  a built-in equivalent, like as is proposed in
  'http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7902', it should be trivial to update
  this to use that instead.
