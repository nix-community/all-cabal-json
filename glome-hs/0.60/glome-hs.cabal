Name:                glome-hs
Version:             0.60
Synopsis:            ray tracer
Description:         Ray Tracer capable of rendering a variety of primitives,
                     with support for CSG (difference and intersection of solids),
                     BIH-based acceleration structure, and ability to load NFF
                     format files.  The rendering algorithms have been abstracted
                     to an external library, GlomeTrace.  This is just a front-end
                     to the library that renders scenes into an opengl window.
