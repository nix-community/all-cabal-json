name: system-posix-redirect
version: 1.1.0.1
synopsis: A toy module to temporarily redirect a program's stdout.
description:
    Due to the design of POSIX, it is possible to temporarily overload the
    file descriptors corresponding to stdout and stderr to point to an
    arbitrary pipe. It is, however, tricky to get right. This module gets
    it right, as far as such a terrible hack can be made right. It can be
    used to make misbehaving third-party C libraries stop spewing to
    standard output. Warning: the module author has concluded that due to
    lack of portability, this module should not be used in any serious
    sytem. But, for those who like living dangerously...
