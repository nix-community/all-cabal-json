Synopsis:        Interprets command line arguments and the contents of a config file as commands and options
Description:
  This library provides an infrastructure to build command line programs. It provides the following features:
  .
  - declare any number of \"actions\" (commands, or modes of operation, of the program);
  .
  - declare options of the program;
  .
  - collect options and actions from a configuration file and the command line, and execute the proper action.
  .
  .
  Examples of using this library may be found in the "Examples" directory in the package tarball.
  .
  .
  It provides functionality similar to the cmdargs package. Main differences:
  .
  - console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;
  .
  - it allows a full tree of \"modes\", instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;
  .
  - it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.
