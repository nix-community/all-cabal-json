Synopsis:        Interprets the command line and a config file as commands and options
Description:
  This library provides an infrastructure to build command line programs. It provides the following features:
  - declare any number of "actions" (commands, or modes of operation, of the program);
  - declare options of the program;
  - collect options and actions from a configuration file and the command line, and execute the proper action.
  
  It provides functionality similar to the "cmdargs" package. Main differences:
  - console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;
  - it allows a full tree of "modes", instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;
  - it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.
