synopsis:        Interpret the command line and contents of a config file as commands and options
description:
  This library provides an infrastructure to build command line programs. It provides the following features:
  .
  - declare any number of \"commands\" (modes of operation) of the program;
  .
  - declare options of these commands;
  .
  - collect options from a configuration file and the command line, and execute the proper command.
  .
  .
  Examples of using this library may be found in the Examples directory in the package tarball.
  .
  .
  It provides functionality similar to the cmdargs package. Main differences:
  .
  - console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;
  .
  - it allows a full tree of commands, instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;
  .
  - it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.
