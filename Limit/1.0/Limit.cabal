Synopsis:      Wrapper for data that can be unbounded
Description:   Limit n is like Maybe n, with (Bounded n) in place of (Just n)
               and Unbounded in place of Nothing. The only difference is that
               âˆ€n. Unbounded >= Bounded n, which makes Limit a good data type
               to deal with numbers that can become unbounded.
