name:                sunlight
version:             0.2.0.0
synopsis:            Test Cabalized package against multiple dependency versions

description:         
  sunlight checks your Cabalized package and ensures that it actually
  builds and passes its tests, even against mulitple dependency
  versions specified in your Cabal file.  For example, your Cabal file
  might say that your package builds against base-4.5.1.0
  and base-4.6.0.1.  With
  sunlight you can automatically verify that this is actually the case.
