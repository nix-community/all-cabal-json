synopsis:            More readable names for commonly used symbols
description:         Readable code is a laudable goal, yet most Haskell code
                     is littered with totally unpronounceable symbols of
                     various sorts. How can code be readable if it's
                     unspeakable?

                     This package is designed to improve upon this sad state
                     of affairs by giving pronounceable aliases to various
                     symbols of all sorts.
