Synopsis:       Process management and supervision daemon

Description:    @scrz@ is a daemon that runs and monitors other processes.
                It is similar to djb's `daemontools`, the Ruby project `god`
                or Haskell's `Angel`.

                It's goals are to keep a set of services running, and to
                facilitate the easy configuration and restart of those
                services.
