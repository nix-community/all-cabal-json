synopsis:            Solve lagrange multiplier problems

-- A longer description of the package.
description:      
 Numerically solve convex lagrange multiplier problems with conjugate gradient descent. 
 .
 For example, find the maximum entropy with the constraint that the probabilities sum
 to one. 
 .
 @
   \> solve 0.00001 (negate . sum . map (\x -> x * log x)) [sum \<=\> 1] 3
   Right ([0.33, 0.33, 0.33], [-0.09])
 @
 .
 The first elements of the result pair are the arguments for the 
 objective function at the minimum. The second elements are the lagrange multipliers.
