Synopsis:       /Arbitrary/ type-level digits

Description: Arbitrary ype-level digits, for when the radix itself doesn't
  actually matter. It's currently base-128, because that seemed to best
  expedite the compilation of the modules using this package. Please let me
  know what you find if you experiment with this.

  'Type.Digits.radix' is the (arbitrary) radix. 'Type.Digits.digit' computes
  the 'NameG' of a digit from its value (assuming its less than the
  radix). Combinators are provided to compute a full type-level numeral from
  values (potentially) larger than the radix.
