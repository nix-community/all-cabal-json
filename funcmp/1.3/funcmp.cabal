Synopsis:               Functional MetaPost
Description:            Functional MetaPost is a Haskell frontend to the
                        MetaPost language by John Hobby. Users write their
                        graphics as Haskell programs, which then emit MetaPost
                        code that can be compiled into encapsulated PostScript
                        files and smoothly included into e.g. LaTeX.
                        .
                        A collection of useful examples how to use Functional
                        MetaPost can be found in the user's manual at
                        <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Manual_eng.ps>. The
                        document doesn't offer very much detail in terms of
                        explanations, but the code samples are quite helpful.
                        .
                        Further documentation can be found in the original
                        thesis that describes the implementation. The text is
                        available in German at
                        <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Thesis.ps> and in

                        Last but not least, there is a tutorial that offers many
                        helpful examples available in German at
