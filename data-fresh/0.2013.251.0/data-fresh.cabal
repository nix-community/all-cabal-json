synopsis:           Interface and functor transformers for fresh values
description:
    A simple library, which contains an interface for generating fresh values.
    .
    This library also includes two functor transformers which implement this
    interface. They consume fresh values from user-supplied comonads.
    Currently, two approaches are implemented:
    .
    * In @Stream@, the comonad provides a way to succeed a value.
    .
    * In @Delta@, the comonad provides a way to split the value or to succeeded
    it. The benefit is that the underlying functor doesn't need to be a monad.
