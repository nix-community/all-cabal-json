synopsis:            List arrows for Haskell.
description:
  This small Haskell library provides some type class, types and functions to
  work with list (and list-like) arrows. List arrows represent computations
  that may return multiple outputs. Making functions that return lists an
  instance of both the `Category` and `Arrow` type class allow you to easily
  compose multiple computations into one with standard building blocks.
