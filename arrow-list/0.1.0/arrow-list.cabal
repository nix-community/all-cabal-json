Synopsis:         List arrows for Haskell.
Description:      This small Haskell library provides some type class, types
                  and functions to work with list arrows. List arrows represent
                  computations that may return multiple outputs. Making
                  functions that return lists an instance of both the
                  `Category` and `Arrow` type class allow you to easily compose
                  multiple computations into one with standard building blocks.
