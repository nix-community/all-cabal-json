Synopsis:         List arrows for Haskell.
Description:      This small Haskell library provides some type class, types
                  and functions to work with list (and list-like) arrows. List
                  arrows represent computations that may return multiple
                  outputs. Making functions that return lists an instance of
                  both the `Category` and `Arrow` type class allow you to
                  easily compose multiple computations into one with standard
                  building blocks.
