synopsis:            Haskell binding to the Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra

description:         Bindings to the Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra.
                     To get started, get the SDK from Sixense (http://sixense.com/developers), install it, then install hydra.hs.

                     The install script that comes with the SDK might not always work. 
		     To build hydra-hs, you need both sixense.h and libsixense.dylib in a location where they can be found (such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib).
