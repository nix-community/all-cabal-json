Name:      relacion 

Version:   0.1

Synopsis:  A relation data structure.

Description:

  A library to model relationships between two objects that are subclasses of
  Ord.
  .
  Instead using a Map structure we use a two Maps that allows 
  fast searching either by the key element or the value element.
  .
  Each of Map is between an element and a set of values. 
  Thus careful coordination of operations is required.
  . 
  This library lacks of extensive testing, formal testing or automated testing.
  Also in comparison to Data.Set or Data.Map (which provide the underlying
  infrastructure used) there are some missing methods. 
  . 
  An example of use is the include source file T02_Relacion.hs.
  .
