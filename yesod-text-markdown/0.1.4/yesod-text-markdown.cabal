synopsis:            Yesod support for Text.Markdown.
description:         Use Text.Markdown in a typical yesod project.
                     This module contains instances related to persistence,
                     even though it isn't tightly coupled to yesod.
                     .
                     This package is different from the yesod-markdown package
                     which uses the pandoc renderer for markdown. The main
                     advantages of having Text.Markdown as underlying renderer
                     is the much smaller dependencies and the permissiver
                     license.  See
                     <https://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-markdown> and
                     <https://github.com/snoyberg/markdown>.
                     .
                     This package intentionally tries to be like
                     yesod-markdown, so switching between the markdown backends
                     should be easy.
                     .
                     If you wonder why the haddocks only show a few exports,
                     it's because it doesn't show exporting of instances which
                     is most of what this package is about.
