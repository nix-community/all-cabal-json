Description:	A version of monad transformers that (a) allows one to convince the type checker that transformer application is a monad, and (b) doesn't need lots of boilerplate to add a new transformer. It's supposed to play nicely with @Control.Monad.Trans@.
		.
		In order to make a new transformer (say, @T@) an instance of @TransM@ (@TransP@, @TransF@) class, all you have to do is:
		.
		* define @instance MonadTrans T@ &#x2014; which you've probably done already
		.
		* define @instance Monad m => Monad (T m)@ &#x2014; also something quite common (for @TransP@ and @TransF@ you'd need another instance for @MonadPlus@ and @MonadFix@, respectively).
		.
		* write @instance Trans T where transMInst = instM@ &#x2014; which is exactly one line of boilerplate. Sorry about that.
		.
		After that, you can use your new and shiny transformer in compositions, like @ReaderT Char :. T :. WriterT String@ &#x2014; and such a composition would automagically become a monad transformer.
