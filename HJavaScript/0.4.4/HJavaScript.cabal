Synopsis:         HJavaScript is an abstract syntax for a typed subset of JavaScript.
Description:      HJavaScript defines an abstract syntax and pretty printer for
                  a subset of JavaScript. as Language.HJavaScript. However, a significant 
                  difference from JavaScript is that HJavaScript is typed, even on the 
                  abstract syntax level using GADTs. The subset of JavaScript that is 
                  supported is those parts that lend themself to typing 
                  (i.e. no prototyping of classes).
