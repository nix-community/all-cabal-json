description:
  Implementation of the MULTEXT-East Version 3 morphosyntactic descriptors.
  MULTEXT-East encodes values of morphosyntatic attributes in a single string, 
  using positional encoding. Each attribute is represented by a single letter 
  at a predefined position, while non-applicable attributes are represented 
  by hyphens. MULTEXT-EAST Version 3 covers morphosyntactic descriptions for 
  Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English, Estonian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, 
  Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Resian, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, 
  Slovene, and Ukrainian. For details, refer to <http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V3/>.
