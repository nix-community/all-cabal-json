                    .
		    To use it, you'll have to install Ubigraph first, see <http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/>
                    .
		    Then run ubigraph server with default settings (with a command like $UBIGRAPH_DIR\/bin\/ubigraph_server)
                    .
		    Then load System.Vacuum.Ubigraph module into the ghci session and use 'view' function, e.g.
                    .
		    > view [1..3]
