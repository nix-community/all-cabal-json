                    .
		    To use it, you'll have to install Ubigraph first, see "http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/"
                    .
		    Then run ubigraph server with default settings (with a command like '$UBIGRAPH_DIR/bin/ubigraph_server')
                    .
		    Then load System.Vacuum.Ubigraph module into the ghci session and use `view' function, e.g.
                    .
		    > view [1..3]
