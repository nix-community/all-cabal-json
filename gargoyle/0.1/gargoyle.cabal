synopsis: Automatically spin up and spin down local daemons
description:
  Gargoyle is a framework for managing daemons from Haskell. In the current release the only requirement is that the daemon be able to communicate over a Unix domain socket. See <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gargoyle-postgresql gargoyle-postgresql> for a fully worked out example.
  .
  To use Gargoyle the client must:
  .
  1. Define a value of the 'Gargoyle' type which specifies how to administer the daemon.
  2. Create an executable whose `main` is 'gargoyleMain'. The name of this executable should match the executable name specified in the '_gargoyle_exec' field of the 'Gargoyle'.
  3. The client will run their code with 'withGargoyle' to gain access to the daemon.
