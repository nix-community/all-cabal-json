description:

    This library defines a set of functions that convert between
    the "Quiver" and "Data.Enumerator" paradigms. The conversion
    is bidirectional: an appropriately-typed stream processor
    can be converted into an 'Data.Enumerator.Iteratee' and back
    into a stream processor. In addition, a stream processor can
    be fed into an iteratee (or 'Data.Enumerator.Step'),
    resulting in an 'Data.Enumerator.Enumerator'.

    The library has been designed specifically for use with Snap,
    but I'm sure that many other interesting uses of it exist.
