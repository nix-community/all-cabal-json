Synopsis:       Maximal sharing of terms in the lambda calculus with letrec
Description:    Parses a lambda-letrec term; transforms it into a first-order
                term graph representation; minimises the graph; reads back a
                lambda-letrec term which has the same unfolding as the original
                term, but exhibits maximal sharing.
                If executable "dot" from graphviz is available, the graphs are
                displayed (tested for Linux).
                The approach is described in a technical report:
