Name:                SBench

Version:             0.1

Synopsis:            A benchmark suite for runtime and heap measurements over 
                     a series of inputs.

Description: The package provides a framework for heap and runtime measurements
             for single Haskell functions. For heap measurements simple programs
             are created, compiled with profiling options and run. You can do
             either a heap profile or a graph for the maximal heap consumption
             of a function over different inputsizes. For runtime measurements
             the criterion library is used.

             Measurement data can be stored in a special file format providing
             besides the data some meta information about the measurement.
	     Furthermore measured data can be plotted easily using gnuplot.
             In particular, it is possible to compare measurements for different
             functions (e.g. different version of a semantically equivalent
             function) in one diagram. By using gnuplot for drawing, the
             appearance of a diagram is very flexible and can be adjusted
             directly to, for example, the style of your paper.
