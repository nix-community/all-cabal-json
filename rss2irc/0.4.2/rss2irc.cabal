 Release notes for 0.4.2, 2009-09-27:
 .
 * fix a bug where every --max-items-th announcement was skipped
 .
 Release notes for 0.4.1, 2009-09-26:
 .
 * fix release notes issues
 .
 Release notes for 0.4, 2009-09-26:
 .
 * wait for server connection confirmation before JOIN command.
  Problem was observed on irc.quakenet.org since it refuses
  to join or any commands before connection is confirmed by server. (Radoslav Dorcik)
 .
 * feed polling now recovers from transient failures
 .
 * can poll a local file: uri as well as remote uris.
  Works if the uri is of the form "file:FILE", at least. Useful for testing
  and eg for announcing a feed generated from a darcs posthook.
 .
 * more robust new item detection, with some alternate strategies
   available via the --announce option. The choices are:
    topnew - new unseen items at the top (default, good for most feeds);
    allnew - new unseen items anywhere;
    top    - any items above the previous top item.
 .
 * --idle option, waits for N minutes of channel idle time before announcing
 .
 * limit individual field sizes, preventing too many irc messages per item.
  Most announcements should now fit in one irc message, and pretty much all
  should fit in two.
 .
 * misc. output improvements: elide identical consecutive item
   descriptions, split long announcements on a word boundary, try to
   complete a split announcement within a batch, better whitespace
   handling
 .
 * logging improvements
 .
 * --delay now takes minutes, not seconds
 .
