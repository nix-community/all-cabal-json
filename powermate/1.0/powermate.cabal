synopsis:            bindings for Griffin PowerMate USB
description:
        This library is for interfacing the Griffin PowerMate USB (a
        big silver knob you can turn and click) with Haskell on Linux.
        Besides reading events from the PowerMate, you can also
        control the brightness, pulse speed, and pulse waveform of the
        built-in LED.
