synopsis: A genetic programming based on tree structure.

description: 
  It based on Data.Dynamic and tree container, so that Gene can represent both haskell functions and syntax trees by type connstructors. since it also supports higher order functions by multiple way type parsing, there's no need to have any variable in Gene's Tree structure.

  take a look at module AI.Heukarya.Center first 
  
  AI.Heukarya.Gene : Abstract Gene manipulation and Typeclass
  AI.Heukarya.Jungle : Operating Collections of Gene
  AI.Heukarya.Center : Module which wraps main functionality for library using

  AI.Heukarya.Gene.Dynamic : one of Gene's implementation. since it's impossible to save checkpoints if using Data.Dynamic directly, a symbolic wrapper around dynamic would be helpful
  AI.Heukarya.Gene.Dynamic.Double : a sample geneList of operators of Double precision numbers
