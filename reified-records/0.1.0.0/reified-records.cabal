version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Reify records to Maps and back again
description:         This package provides a pair of functions @reify@ and @reflect@ to allow records to be manipulated dynamically as @Map@s.
                     Currently this works using @Data.Data@ however in future this will likely change to @GHC.Generics@ and allow more user hooks
                     into how types are reified and reflected.

                     This package is meant to be a useful tool in writing serialization libraries for JSON and similar.
