-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Sequential index numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that allow arbitrarily inserting new numbers in between (for special containers).

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         Sequential index numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that allow arbitrarily inserting new numbers in between. They can possibly used for disk-based and other special containers, where adding a new element without changing the indexes of the other elements is important.
                     
                     Conceptually, SequentialIndex denotes a path to an element in an imaginary binary tree.
