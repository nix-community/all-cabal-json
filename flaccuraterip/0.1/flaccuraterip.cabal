Synopsis:       Verify FLAC files ripped form CD using AccurateRip™
Description:

  /flAccurateRip/ is a command line tool to verify the accuracy of FLAC
  files ripped form CD, using the information contained in the
  AccurateRip™ database about other rips of the same CD.
  .
  To use it, open a shell and run
  .
  >>> cd DIR_CONTAINING_RIPPED_FLAC_FILES
  >>> flaccuraterip *.flac
  .
  Notice: to work correctly, *.flac should expand to the list of flac
  files corresponding to the tracks of the CD you want to verify, and
  in the same order as they appear on the CD.
