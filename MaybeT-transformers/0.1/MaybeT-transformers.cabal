Name:                MaybeT-transformers
Version:             0.1
Cabal-version:       >= 1.6
Synopsis:            MaybeT monad transformer using transformers instead of mtl.
Description:         Support for computations with failures. This
                     package is a fork from the MaybeT package by Eric
                     Kidd, changed to depend on transformers instead
                     of mtl. It also adds a few more utility
                     functions.
