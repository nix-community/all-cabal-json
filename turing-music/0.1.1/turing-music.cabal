name:           turing-music
version:        0.1.1
synopsis:       Plays music generated by Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols
description:    
    turing-music interprets 42 built-in Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols.
    In every 0.1 second, a motion is done and the contents of the tape is printed.
    At the same time, a sound is played. The pitch of the sound depends on the position of the last change
    on the tape.
    .
    The built-in machines are busy beaver candidates. 
    A busy beaver is a Turing machine which, when given an empty tape, does a lot of work, then halts.
    Currently it is not known whether these simple machines halt or not.
