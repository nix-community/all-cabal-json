Description:
  Provides functions to throw and catch exceptions. Unlike the functions from
  @Control.Exception@, which work in @IO@, these work in any stack of monad
  transformers (from the 'transformers' package) with @IO@ as the base monad.
  You can extend this functionality to other monads, by creating an instance
  of the @MonadCatchIO@ class.
  
  Warning: this package is deprecated. Use the 'exceptions' package instead,
  if possible.
