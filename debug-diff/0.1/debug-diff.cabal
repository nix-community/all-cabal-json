description:
  @Debug.Diff@ is a quick tool for comparing two Haskell values, as
  when diagnosing a test failure.  It pretty-prints the values
  (using the @groom@ library) and passes them to an external @diff@
  command (@colordiff@ by default), which writes the diff to standard
  output.
  .
  @Debug.Diff.Config@ provides more control over the diff parameters.
