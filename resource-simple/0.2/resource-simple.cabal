description:
  This is a simplified, standalone version of the @ResourceT@ transformer that
  was originally developed as part of the @conduit@ package. That version of
  @ResourceT@ was supported by a complicated hierarchy of type classes, the
  main purpose of which was to enable the usage of @ResourceT@ on top of the
  @ST@ monad. However, this doesn't really make much sense conceptually, and
  the reason it was done is because conduits are very closely tied to
  @ResourceT@, and an instance for @ST@ would enable the usage of @ResourceT@
  in pure code.
  .
  This package completely does away with the supporting type class hierarchy,
  and as such, this version of @ResourceT@ can only be used with @IO@ or
  @IO@-like monads.
  .
  This package is motivated by a belief that the iteratee problem and the
  resource finalization problem are orthogonal. This package is ideal for
  usage with the @pipes@ library.
