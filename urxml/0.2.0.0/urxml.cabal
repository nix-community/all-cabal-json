version:             0.2.0.0
synopsis:            XML parser-printer supporting Ur/Web syntax extensions
description:         UrXML is yet another XML parser/pretty-printer based on
                     [RSXP](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/really-simple-xml-parser) package by
                     CK Kashyap.

                     UrXML is vim-friendly and can be used to pretty-print the XML-fragment of
                     non-XML file.

                     Additionaly, the tool is able to translate the usual XML into
                     [Ur/Web](http://www.impredicative.com/ur/) dialect of XML (uses several
                     hardcoded rules)
