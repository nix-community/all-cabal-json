Description:
   TimeCalc is a very simple utility for calculating times. I use it for calculating splits or predicting race times. It is a calculator that supports doubles and times. For example:
   .
   If I run 5 kilometers at 3:30/kilometer, the race will take me 17:30.
   .
   > 5*3:30
   > 17:30
   .
   If I want to know how fast my splits need to be in order to run a 10K in 37:00.
   .
   > 37:00/10
   > 3:42
   .
   If I want to add two times:
   .
   > 3:42 + 3:30 + 3:49
   > 11:01
   .
   Or calculating the splits Bekele needs to run on the marathon:
   .
   > 2:02:13 / 42.195
   > 2:54
   .
   Which is very fast, indeed.
