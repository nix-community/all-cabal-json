Synopsis:            Automated clustering of arbitrary elements in Haskell.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         Hieraclus is a library that supports clustering of arbitrary elements in haskell. The 
                     difference to the already existing cluster library "hierarchical-clustering" is the ability
                     to work with abort criterias which allow an "intelligent" clustering. With the help of
                     abort criterias the user can specify conditions that must be fulfilled in order to stop
                     the clustering process.
