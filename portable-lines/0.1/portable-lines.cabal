synopsis:            Alternative 'lines' implementation that understands CR-LF and CR
description:
    Provides an alternative implementation of the 'Prelude.lines' function that
    treats the following sequences as newline characters:
    .
    * @\"\\r\\n\"@ (Windows style)
    .
    * @\"\\r\"@ (Macintosh style, before OS X)
    .
    * @\"\\n\"@ (Unix style)
    .
    Haskell's IO system supports both platform-specific line ending conversion
    (by opening the file in \"text mode\"), and explicit setting of the newline
    mode for input and output (see 'System.IO.hSetNewlineMode').  However:
    .
    * If you don't know the line ending format in advance, you would have to
      open the file and detect the newline format manually.
    .
    * ByteString currently honors neither of these; see
      <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6837628>.
