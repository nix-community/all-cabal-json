Name:                plugins-auto
Version:             0.0.4
Synopsis:            Automatic recompilation and reloading of haskell modules.
Description:         This library provides support for automatically recompiling and reloading
                     modules into your programs when the source code is modified. 
                     .
                     Any program called ghc in your PATH will be used for recompiling.
