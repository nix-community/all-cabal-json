Description:
  This library provides pretty-print operators similar to the set provided by the Wadler-Leijin pretty-printer.
  The main difference, however, is that it utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm for rendering.  This slightly
  reduces the available combinators, but provides a layout engine that optimizes documents, minimizing their
  over-wrap and line count.
  .
  The dynamic programming algorithm has pathological cases that cause it to run in quadratic time; however,
  typical use on code-like programs should see better run times.  In general, documents with many uses of the
  choose combinator will require more time to render.
  .
  This library also provides two simpler rendering engines for uses where the full optimal layout engine is not
  necessary.  These engines are much simpler and consume fewer resources.
