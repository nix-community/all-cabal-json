synopsis:            haskell binding to ipopt including automatic differentiation
description:  a haskell binding to the nonlinear programming solver ipopt
              <http://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt>
              .
              [@installation@]
              needs ipopt installed: For example if you have a
              `/usr/include/coin/IpStdCInterface.h` from your ipopt installation,
              use:
             .
              > cabal install ipopt-hs --extra-include-dirs=/usr/include/coin
             .
              A embedded language, similar to the one provided by glpk-hs, is
              defined in "Ipopt.NLP". The goal is to define problems at a level
              similar to other "algebraic modeling languages", but retain some
              of the safety and flexibility available in haskell. There is some
              overhead <http://code.haskell.org/~aavogt/ipopt-hs/examples/bench.html>
              but at least on the small 4-variable constrained optimization
              problem.
             .
              Current limitations include:
             .
              * copying in every iteration happens between between
                "Data.Vector.Storable" and "Data.Vector" might be avoidable
                somehow.  Currently it is done because AD needs a Traversable
                structure, but Storable vectors are not traversable.
             .
              * sparseness of derivatives isn't used
             .
              * no binding to SetIntermediateCallback
