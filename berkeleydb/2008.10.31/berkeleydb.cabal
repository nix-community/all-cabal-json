Synopsis:        Pretty BerkeleyDB v4 binding.
Description:
  This library attempts to provide a memory efficient alternative to
  Data.Map. The BerkeleyDB system is bound and exposed through an
  interface that mimics Data.Map as much as possible.
  .
  Features include: pure interface with fairly efficient sharing
  and a very small memory footprint.
  .
  Tested with libdb4.6
