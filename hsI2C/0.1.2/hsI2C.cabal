synopsis:            I2C access for Haskell and Linux
description:         This library provides a Haskell interface to I2C on Linux via  /dev/i2c. It wrapps the libi2c c-library that is included as c-bits. Beware that poking the internal I2C buses of your PC or laptop may cause hardware damage. I test and use this library with an external i2c_tiny_usb adapter. (Note that the i2c_tiny_usb kernel driver is broken in 4.9 and 4.11. But it works with this patch: https:\/\/patchwork.kernel.org\/patch\/9711919\/)
