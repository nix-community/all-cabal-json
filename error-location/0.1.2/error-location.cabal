Description: 
    > $(err "OH NO!")
    >
    > main:Main main.hs:16:1 OH NO!

    Notice how it displays package:module file:line:character
    It exposes the functions err (error), undef (undefined), and trc (Debug.Trace.trace). All of these behave the same as their normal counterpart but also spit out a location.

    I also included my favorite helper, debug, which is like trace but just show the value. No TH version with location yet.

    > debug [1,2,3]
    >
    > DEBUG: [1,2,3]
    > [1,2,3]
