synopsis:            Parse VCS changelogs into ChangeLogs
description:         change-monger is intended to allow you to extract
                     the revision history from various VCSes like Darcs,
                     and save them as a ChangeLog; particularly important
                     is being able to extract the summaries for all patches
                     since the last release.
