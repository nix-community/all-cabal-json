Synopsis:	Generate FFI import declarations from C include files
Description:	Haskell FFI Binding Modules Generator (HSFFIG) is a tool that parses 
		C library include files (.h) and generates Haskell Foreign Functions Interface 
		import declarations for all functions, #define'd constants (where possible), 
                enumerations, and structures/unions (to access their members). 
                It is assumed that the GNU C Compiler and Preprocessor are used. 
                Auto-generated Haskell modules may be imported into an application 
                to get access to the foreign library's functions and variables.
                .
                The package provides a small library that programs using auto-generated
                imports have to link to (specify HSFFIG as one of build-depends), and two 
                executable programs:
                .
                  * hsffig: a filter program reading pre-processed include files 
                from standard input, and producing one large .hsc file to be processed 
                by @hsc2hs@, and possibly cut into pieces by @modsplit@. See
                <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial> for more information.
                .
                  * ffipkg: a wrapper over @hsffig@ which automates the process of
                building a Cabal package out of C include files provided by running
                the preprocessor, @hsffig@, the splitter, and preparing the files
                necessary to build a package. See 
                <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FFI_imports_packaging_utility> for
                more information.
                .
                Please note that @hsffig@ and @ffipkg@ will likely not work properly
                with C++ include files.
