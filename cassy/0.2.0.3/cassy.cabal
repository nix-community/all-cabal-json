description:
  The objective is to completely isolate away the thrift layer, providing
  a more idiomatic Haskell experience working with Cassandra.
  .
  Certain parts of the API was inspired by pycassa (Python client) and
  hscassandra (on Hackage).
  .
  A brief explanation of modules:
  . 
  * /Database.Cassandra.Basic/: Contains a low level, simple
    implementation of Cassandra interaction using the thrift API
    underneath.
  .
  * /Database.Cassandra.JSON/: A higher level API that operates on
    values with ToJSON and FromJSON isntances from the /aeson/
    library. This module has in part been inspired by Bryan
    O\'Sullivan\'s /riak/ client for Haskell.
  .
  * /Database.Cassandra.Pool/: Handles a /pool/ of connections to
    multiple servers in a cluster, splitting the load among them.
  .
  * /Database.Cassandra.Types/: A common set of types used everywhere.
  .
  Potential TODOs include:
  .
  * Support for counters and batch mutators
  .
  * Support for database admin operations
  .
  * Support for composite column types
