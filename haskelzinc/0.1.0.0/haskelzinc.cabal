-- A longer description of the package.
description:      This library aims to link Haskell with MiniZinc. It 
                  provides an abstract syntax tree for the MiniZinc 
                  language, with which one can define MiniZinc 
                  constraint models. One can directly get the solution(s) 
                  of the model or separately use the corresponding modules 
                  of the library to pretty-print the model or parse its 
                  solution(s).
