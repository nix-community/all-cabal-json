Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming\nlanguage with a type-checker and evaluator.\n\nUse this library to parse, type-check, evaluate, and pretty-print the Dhall\nconfiguration language.  This package also includes an executable which\ntype-checks a Dhall file and reduces the file to a fully evaluated normal\nform.\n\nRead \"Dhall.Tutorial\" to learn how to use this library",
