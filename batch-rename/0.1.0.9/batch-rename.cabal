-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Make Linux or MacOS do things like "rename *.mp3 *.mp4"

-- A longer description of the package.
description:      Do you remember the convenient command `ren' in MSDOS?
                  When you want to change all your .mp3 files to .mp4.
                  Simply type \"ren *.mp3 *.mp4.\". 
                  I really like this.
                  But in linux\/Mac world, people keep asking how.(http:\/\/bit.ly\/2cIskUu)
                  So maybe this little tool can help you a lot.
