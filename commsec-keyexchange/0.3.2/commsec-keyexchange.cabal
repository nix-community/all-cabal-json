name:                commsec-keyexchange
version:             0.3.2
synopsis:            Key agreement for commsec.
description:         Use RSA keys to authenticate a key exchange to
                     establish a commsec 'Connection'.  This package comes with
                     the same warnings as 'commsec': There is minimal testing
                     and no code review.  Use at your own risk.
