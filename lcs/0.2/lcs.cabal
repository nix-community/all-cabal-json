Synopsis:           Find longest common sublist of two lists
Description:
    Provides a function lcs that takes two lists and returns a longest
    common sublist. For example, lcs "abcd" "acbd" is either "abd" or
    "acd".
    .
    The package provides a simple, stupid and (most of all) slow
    implementation that needs, for inputs of length m and n, O(m+n)
    space and O((m+n)!) time in the worst case.
    .
    It also provides an implementation of the Hunt-Szymanski LCS
    algorithm, based on that in "String searching algorithms" by
    Graham A Stephen, ISBN 981021829X.
    .
    Given inputs xs and ys of length m and n respectively, where there
    are r pairs (x, y) where x is in xs, y is in ys and x == y,
    Hunt-Szymanski needs O(r+m+n) space and O((r+m+n)*log(m+n)) time.
    Thus this is O((m+n)^2) space and O((m+n)^2*log(m+n)) time in the
    worst case.
