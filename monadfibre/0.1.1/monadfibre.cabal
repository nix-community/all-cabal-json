Name:                monadfibre
Version:             0.1.1
Description:         This package defines Monadic functions which provide Choice and Parallelism - (<||>) and (<&&>)
                     - that work on Monads that provide a (MonadBi m ()) instance.
                     Also included is a Class called @MonadBi@ which acts as a superset
                     of @MonadTrans@, and provides @raise@ analogous to @lift@ as well
                     as @lower@, which goes the other way.
                     Natural instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.

Synopsis:            This package defines Monadic functions which provide Choice and Parallelism - (<||>) and (<&&>).
