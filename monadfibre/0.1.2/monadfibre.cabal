Description:         This package defines Monadic functions which provide Choice and Parallelism - (&lt;||&rt;) and (&lt;&&&rt;)
                     - that work on Monads that provide a (MonadBi m IO) instance.

                     Depends on the @monadbi@ library for extracting the IO actions from m. Also provides a good example of how to use the library.

Synopsis:            Monadic functions which provide Choice and Parallelism.
