Synopsis:            An alternate implementation of push-pull FRP.
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:         An alternate implementation of push-pull FRP. This is based on the Reactive package (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/reactive) (and the sources have been made available in accordance with the GPL [license] of that package).
   .
   Known problems with this version:
   .
   * The UI library tends to freeze after a few seconds of use. Don't know whether the problem is semantical or a deadlock. The core library works correctly though.
   .
   * There seems to be a speed problem that I can't identify, but it doesn't appear to be fundamental.
   .
   * UI library is currently on Windows only, but there are plans....
