description:
  Package @rtld@ provides simplistic interface to the dynamic linker/loader.
  It wraps 'dlopen/dlclose' family of functions ('LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary'
  on Windows) and tries to provide a common interface to dynamically load
  foreign libraries at runtime. It is used currently as a helper package
  for @curlhs@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curlhs>), but is not
  ready for the public use (more tests and design decisions needed).
  .
  Package is distributed under ISC License (MIT/BSD-style, see LICENSE file
  for details). It is marked as @OtherLicense@ due to limitations of Cabal.
