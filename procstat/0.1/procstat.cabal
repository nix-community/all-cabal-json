Synopsis:            get information on processes in Linux

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         procstat is a clean interface to the Linux /proc
                     filesystem; specifically, the /proc/[0-9]+/stat files.
                     It essentially parses the process data found in those
                     files into a more semantic data structure.
