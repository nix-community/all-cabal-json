Synopsis:               Generic splay-based sequence representation
Description:
                        /WARNING/: This package is /unstable/, do not use
                        except for testing.
                        .
                        A general sequence representation with arbitary
                        annotations, for use as a base for implementations
                        of various collection types.
                        .
                        The splay operation in this package is implemented
                        using a top-down approach.
                        .
                        Some parts of the documentation are based on those
                        in the @containers@ and @fingertree@ package.
