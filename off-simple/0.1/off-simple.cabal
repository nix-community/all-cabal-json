Synopsis:            A parser for simplified-syntax OFF files
Description:         A simple datatype and parser for 3D OFF files, 
                     loosely based on 
                     <http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/off/off.html>, 
                     but uses the file header to determine whether the object's
                     faces contain color values.
