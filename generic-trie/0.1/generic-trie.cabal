version:             0.1
synopsis:            A map, where the keys may be complex structured data.
description:         This type implements maps where the keys are themeselves
                     complexs strucutured data.  For example, the keys may be
                     the abstract syntax trees for a programming language.
                     The map is implemented as a trie, so common parts of the
                     keys will be shared in the representation.  The library
                     provides a generic implementation of the data strucutre,
                     so values of types that have support for 'Generic' may
                     be automatically used as keys in the map.
