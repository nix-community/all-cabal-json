version:             4.0.0.0
-- synopsis:            
description:         This library is useful for running a large amount of parallel tasks
                     that run on top of the IO monad, executing them in batches from a work queue.
                     .
                     It has several features aimed at monitoring the progress of the tasks
                     and tries to be reasonably efficient (in space and time) for large
                     numbers (millions) of tasks.  There is also caching support available so that the results of
                     running the task can be preserved between runs of the same program, which
                     is useful for doing scientific analysis.
