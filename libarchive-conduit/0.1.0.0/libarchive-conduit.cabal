description:
  @libarchive-conduit@ reads archives with @libarchive@. All of the many
  formats understood by @libarchive@ are supported. Resource use is
  managed in Haskell with the @conduit@ library. The interface is very
  simple; archives are read from disk and their contents are presende as
  a stream of pairs @(FilePath, ByteString)@ of the path to each file
  and its contents, respectively.
