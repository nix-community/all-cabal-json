Synopsis:            Binary fixed-point arithmetic
Description:         This package defines a type for binary
                     fixed-precision arithmetic. Its interface is
                     intended to be almost the same as the one
                     provided by Data.Fixed. The main differences are
                     that this is binary fixed-point and it's
                     polymorphic in the underlying representation.
