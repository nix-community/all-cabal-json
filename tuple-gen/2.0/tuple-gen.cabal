Name:             tuple-gen
Version:          2.0
Synopsis:         Enum instances for tuples where the digits increase with the same speed
Description:      Generating tuples like this: [(x, y) | x <- [1..], y <- [1..]] generates tuples that change only in the second position.
                  .
                  This library uses increasingly bigger hyperplanes to generate tuples.
                  .
                  It uses the Enum instances that are also used in the Prelude.
                  .
                  Thereby tuples with arbitrary starting values and types can be enumerated.
                  .
                  Example:  ( enumFrom (0,(1,2),3) ) :: [(Word8,(Word8,Word8),Word8)]
                  .
                  evaluates to [(0,(1,2),3), (0,(2,1),4), (0,(3,0),5), ...].
                  .
                  Further explanations are planned to appear in the Monad Reader issue 20.
