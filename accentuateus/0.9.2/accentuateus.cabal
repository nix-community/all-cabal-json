Name:                accentuateus
Version:             0.9.2
Homepage:            http://accentuate.us/
Synopsis:            A Haskell implementation of the Accentuate.us API.
Description:         Accentuate.us (<http://accentuate.us/>) is a free
                     and open-source web service that makes computer
                     input really easy for over 115 languages. Using
                     statistics, it will automatically add diacritics
                     (\"special characters\") to otherwise plain text.
                     In support of being an open web service, an API is
                     provided and documented at
                     <http://accentuate.us/api>, which is implemented
                     by this package.
