Synopsis:            Fast size comparison for standard containers.
Description:         SizeCompare is a small library providing size comparison functions standard Haskell data-types.
                     Size compare runs in O(min(n,m)) for both arguments, possibly faster.

                     Instead of measuring both containers and comparing the result, SizeCompare iteratively deconstructs both
                     sides of the equality equation until a conclusion can be made.

                     A common expression like:

                     length xs > 0

                     runs O(n) in the length of the list. Sizecompare runs (O(1)) in this particular case:

                     xs |>| 0
                     
                     This is still an initial version of the library and updates may follow after some more profiling.
