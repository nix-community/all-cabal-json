Synopsis: Binding group analysis in Template Haskell

Description: th-sccs exposes Template Haskell functions for computing the
             mutually recursive binding groups for data and type synonym
             declarations, excluding those that use type families.
             
             This includes a convenient type class for gathering the type
             constructor names that occur within a TH @Info@\/@Dec@\/@Type@
             value.
