synopsis:
  Hath manipulates network blocks in CIDR notation.
description:
  Hath is a Haskell program for working with network blocks in CIDR
  notation. When dealing with blocks of network addresses, there are a
  few things that one usually wants to do with them:
  .
    * Create a regular expression matching the CIDR block(s). This is
      because grep will throw up if you feed it CIDR.
  .
    * Combine small blocks into larger ones. For example, if you have two
      consecutive \/24s, they might combine into a larger \/23.
  .
    * View the result of block combination in a useful way.
  .
  Hath has four modes to perform these functions:
  .
    [@Regexed@]
    This computes a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching
    the input CIDR blocks. It's the default mode of operation.
  .
    [@Reduced@]
    This combines small blocks into larger ones where possible, and
    eliminates redundant blocks. The output should be equivalent to
    the input, though.
  .
    [@Duped@]
    Shows only the blocks that would be removed by reduce; that is, it
    shows the ones that would get combined into larger blocks or are
    simply redundant.
  .
    [@Diffed@]
    Shows what would change if you used reduce. Uses diff-like
    notation.
  .
  /Examples/:
  .
  Combine two \/24s into a \/23:
  .
  @
  $ hath reduced <<< \"10.0.0.0\/24 10.0.1.0\/24\"
  10.0.0.0/23
  @
  .
  Create a perl-compatible regex to be fed to grep:
  .
  @
  $ grep -P `hath regexed -i cidrs.txt` mail.log
  @
