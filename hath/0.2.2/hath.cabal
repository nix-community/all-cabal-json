synopsis:
  Hath manipulates network blocks in CIDR notation.
description:
  Hath is a Haskell program for working with network blocks in CIDR
  notation. When dealing with blocks of network addresses, there are a
  few things that one usually wants to do with them:
  .
    * Create a regular expression matching the CIDR block(s). This is
      because grep will throw up if you feed it CIDR.
  .
    * Combine small blocks into larger ones. For example, if you have two
      consecutive \/24s, they might combine into a larger \/23.
  .
    * View the result of block combination in a useful way.
  .
    * List them.
  .
    * Find their associated PTR records.
  .
  Hath has several modes to perform these functions:
  .
    [@Regexed@]
    This computes a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching
    the input CIDR blocks. It's the default mode of operation.
  .
    [@Reduced@]
    This combines small blocks into larger ones where possible, and
    eliminates redundant blocks. The output should be equivalent to
    the input, though.
  .
    [@Duped@]
    Shows only the blocks that would be removed by reduce; that is, it
    shows the ones that would get combined into larger blocks or are
    simply redundant.
  .
    [@Diffed@]
    Shows what would change if you used reduce. Uses diff-like
    notation.
  .
    [@Listed@]
    List the IP addresses contained within the given CIDRs.
  .
    [@Reversed@]
    Perform reverse DNS (PTR) lookups on the IP addresses contained
    within the given CIDRs.
  .
  /Examples/:
  .
  Compute a (Perl-compatible) regular expression matching
  the input CIDR blocks. It's the default mode of operation.
  .
  @
  $ hath <<< \"10.0.0.0\/29 10.0.0.8\/29\"
  ((10)\.(0)\.(0)\.(15|14|13|12|11|10|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0))
  @
  .
  Combine two \/24s into a \/23:
  .
  @
  $ hath reduced <<< \"10.0.0.0\/24 10.0.1.0\/24\"
  10.0.0.0/23
  @
  .
  List the addresses in 192.168.0.240\/29:
  .
  @
  $ hath listed <<< 192.168.0.240\/29
  192.168.0.240
  192.168.0.241
  192.168.0.242
  192.168.0.243
  192.168.0.244
  192.168.0.245
  192.168.0.246
  192.168.0.247
  @
  .
  Perform PTR lookups on all of 198.41.0.4\/30:
  .
  @
  $ hath reversed <<< 198.41.0.4\/30
  198.41.0.4: a.root-servers.net.
  198.41.0.5:
  198.41.0.6: rs.internic.net.
  198.41.0.7:
  @
  .
  The DNS lookups are usually the bottleneck for this mode, but we can
  perform them in parallel. Simply pass the number of threads to the
  GHC runtime on the command line; for example, the following will
  perform 25 lookups in parallel:
  .
  @
  $ hath reversed +RTS -N25 <<< 198.41.0.4\/24
  198.41.0.4: a.root-servers.net.
  198.41.0.5:
  198.41.0.6: rs.internic.net.
  ...
  @
  .
  The command-line syntax and complete set of options are documented in
  the man page.
