Name:                   cabal-macosx
Version:                0.1.2.1
Stability:              Alpha
Synopsis:               Cabal support for creating Mac OSX application bundles.
Description:

    GUI applications on Mac OSX must be run as application /bundles/;
    these wrap an executable in a particular directory structure which
    can also carry resources such as icons, program metadata, other
    binaries, and copies of shared libraries.

    This package provides Cabal support for creating such application
    bundles.

    For more information about OSX application bundles, look for the
    /Bundle Programming Guide/ on the /Apple Developer Connection/
    website, <http://developer.apple.com/>.
