Synopsis: Binding to sources of high-efficiency, high-precision, monotonically
    increasing relative time.
Description: Haskell binding to sources of high-efficiency, high-precision,
    monotonically increasing relative time. Tested only on amd64 though, so use
    it at your own risk. Most of the credit should go to Matteo Frigo and Martin
    Grabmuller, I only cleaned up the documentation.
