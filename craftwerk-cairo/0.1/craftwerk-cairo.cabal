Synopsis:            Cairo backend for Craftwerk.
Description:	     Cairo backend for Craftwerk, a high-level and easy to use graphics library
                     with integrated TikZ output.
                     .                     		     
		     Craftwerk is a high-level 2D vector graphics library for output of
		     TikZ pictures that can be typeset using (pdf)LaTeX. The TikZ library
		     and documentation can be found at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf>.
		     .			  
		     Craftwerk tries to encapsulate the graphics backend such that figures
		     can also be rendered with a Cairo backend and quickly displayed in a
		     Gtk window. The aim is to support TikZ and Cairo seamlessly as
		     possible, meaning that graphics produced with either backend should
		     look as similar as possible. Other backends are easily written and the
		     aim is to provide generic fallback functions for features that are not
		     natively supported by some backend.
