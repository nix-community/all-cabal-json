description:
    The Matrix Market (MM) exchange formats provide a simple mechanism
    to facilitate the exchange of matrix data. In particular, the 
    objective has been to define a minimal base ASCII file format which
    can be very easily explained and parsed, but can easily adapted to
    applications with a more rigid structure, or extended to related
    data objects. The MM exchange format for matrices is really a 
    collection of affiliated formats which share design elements. In the
    initial specification, two matrix formats are defined.
    .
    Coordinate Format - A file format suitable for representing general
    sparse matrices. Only nonzero entries are provided, and the coordinates
    of each nonzero entry is given explicitly. 
    .
    Array Format - A file format suitable for representing general dense
    matrices. All entries are provided in a pre-defined (column-oriented)
    order.
    .
    We extend the above two storage schemes to vectors, as well.
    .
