Synopsis:         A small scheme interpreter
Description:      This is a moderately complete small scheme interpreter.
                  It implements most of R6RS, with the exception of call/cc.
                  It has a macro system, although not R6RS hygienic macros.
                  It is also not necessarily fully tail-recursive; so it's
                  not industrial-strength. For playing with or learning
                  scheme, it should be pretty good.
