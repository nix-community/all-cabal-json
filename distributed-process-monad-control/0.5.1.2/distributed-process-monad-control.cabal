description:          
  This module exports instances for @'MonadBase' @'IO' and
  @'MonadBaseControl' @'IO' for the @'Process' monad. This is for use
  in conjunction with a library requiring these instances, such as the
  @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base lifted-base> package.
  .
  A tutorial segment regarding use of this in distributed-process applications may
  be found <http://haskell-distributed.github.io/tutorials/3ch.html#monad-transformer-stacks here>.
  .
  Please excercise caution in usage of this instance, as it can
  enable use of functions such as 'forkIO' (or, 'fork' from 'lifted-base')
  which compromise invariants in the Process monad and can lead to confusing
  and subtle issues. Always use the Cloud Haskell functions such as `spawnLocal` instead.
  .
  example usage:
  . 
  >import Control.Distributed.Process.MonadBaseControl()
  >import Control.Concurrent.MVar.Lifted (withMVar)
  >   
  >processWithMVar :: MVar a -> (a -> Process b) -> Process b
  >processWithMvar = withMVar
