Synopsis:    shell-/perl- like (systems) programming in Haskell

Description: The shellisg package provides a single module for convenient
             \"systems\" programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX
             shells or PERL.
             .
               * Elegance and safety is sacrificed for conciseness and
                 swiss-army-knife-ness.
             .
               * The interface exported by Shellish is thread-safe.
             .
             Overall, the module should help you to get a job done quickly,
             without getting too dirty.
