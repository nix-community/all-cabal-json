name:                exceptional
version:             0.3.0.0
synopsis:            Essentially the Maybe type with error messages.
description:         
  This is a very simple type:
  .
  > data Exceptional x
  >   = Failure String
  >   | Success x
  .
  It's much like @Maybe@, except instead of @Nothing@, we have @Failure
  String@.
  .
  A comparison could also be made to @Either String@. I made this library
  because I was dissatisfied with the @Monad@ instance for @Either@. In this
  type, @fail = Failure@. It's rather simple.
  .
  Changes
  .
  [0.3.0.0] Fix erroneous behavior in @foldExceptional@ function added in
            version 0.2. This release actually does break (or rather fix) the
            @foldExceptional@ function, so be careful.
  .
  [0.2.0.0] Add @exceptional@ function to encapsulate ordinary exceptions in the
            @Exceptional@ monad. Add folding functions.
            .
            This release does not actually break the API, however I was rather
            tired when I chose the version number. This should be 0.1.6.
  .
  [0.1.5.0] Add @exceptIO@ function to encapsulate IO errors in the
            @Exceptional@ monad.
  .
  [0.1.4.3] Fix bug where @exceptional@ won't compile on @base < 4.8@.
            Also move the changelog back to the description so it's more
            visible.
  .
  [0.1.4.2] Moved change log to a separate file so Hackage displays
            it correctly.
  .
  [0.1.4.1] Documentation enhancements/fixes.
  .
  [0.1.4.0] Added @fromMaybe@ and @toMaybe@ functions, and a link to
  the bug tracker.
  .
  [0.1.3.0] Fixed a typo. 0.1.2.0 won't build. Also added definition
  of @empty@ for @Alternative@.
  .
  [0.1.2.0] Added @fromEither@ and @toEither@ functions.
  .
  [0.1.1.3] Hackage is terrible. Yet another formatting fix.
  .
  [0.1.1.2] Yet another formatting fix.
  .
  [0.1.1.1] Formatting fix to the haddock documentation.
  .
  [0.1.1.0] Add @runExceptional@ function.
  .
  [0.1.0.1] Minor documentation changes. No changes to the API.
  .
