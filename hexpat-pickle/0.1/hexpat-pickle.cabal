Version: 0.1
Synopsis: XML picklers based on hexpat, almost source code compatible with HXT
Description:
  A library of combinators that allows Haskell data structures to be pickled
  to/from the Tree datatype defined in the hexpat package. It is almost source
  code compatible with the pickling functionality of the HXT package, to allow
  you to switch easily between the two implementations. This implementation is
  simpler and more limited than HXT, but considerably faster.
  This package does not depend on HXT.
