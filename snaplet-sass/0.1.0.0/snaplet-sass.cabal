description:         
    Sass integration for Snap with request based compilation during development and precompilation in production.
    .
    Get started by reading through the <https://github.com/lukerandall/snaplet-sass README>.
    .
    = Brief overview
    .
    Add the snaplet to your App in Application.hs
    .
    > import Snap.Snaplet.Sass
    >
    > data App = App [
    >     _sass :: Snaplet Sass
    >     ] -- these should be curly braces but haddock doesn't allow it
    .
    In Site.hs, add a route for sass to serve from and initialize the snaplet
    .
    > routes = [..., ("/sass", with sass sassServe)]
    >
    > app :: SnapletInit App App
    > app = makeSnaplet "app" "A snaplet example application." Nothing $ do
    >   s <- nestSnaplet "sass" sass initSass
    > return $ App s
    .
    Now add your Sass files to snaplets\/sass\/src and they'll be served
    at \/sass\//FILE/.css. Take note that the .sass or .scss extension will
    be replaced with .css.
