version:             0.1
category:            Development
synopsis:            A recapitulated prelude with minimal dependencies
                     and profligate exports.
description:         Fugue intends to scratch that itchy feeling you
                     get when you realize you need to import `Data.Foldable`,
                     then hide `foldr` from the prelude; when you can't decide
                     whether to go all the way to the top of your buffer to
                     import `Control.Monad` to get `forM` or just use
                     (`flip` `mapM`) instead. Importing `Control.Applicative`
                     just for (\<$\>) is annoying, but so is writing ``fmap``
                     everywhere. Fugue exports a bunch of useful stuff so you
                     don't have to, tending to prefer more general functions
                     from various and sundry corners of the base libraries to
                     those in `Prelude`.
