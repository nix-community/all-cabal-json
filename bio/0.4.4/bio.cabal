Synopsis:            A bioinformatics library
Description:         This is a collection of data structures and algorithms
                     useful for building bioinformatics-related tools
                     and utilities.
                     .
                     Current list of features includes: a Sequence data type supporting
                     protein and nucleotide sequences and conversion between them.  As of version
		     0.4, different kinds of sequence have different types.  Support for quality
                     data, reading and writing Fasta formatted files, reading TwoBit and
                     phd formats, and Roche/454 SFF files.  Rudimentary (i.e. unoptimized) support
		     for doing alignments - including dynamic adjustment of scores based on sequence quality. 
		     Also Blast output parsing.  Partly implemented single linkage clustering, and
		     multiple alignment.  Reading Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (GOA) and
		     definitions\/hierarchy.
