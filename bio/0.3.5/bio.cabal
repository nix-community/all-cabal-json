Synopsis:            A bioinformatics library
Description:         This is a collection of data structures and algorithms
                     I've found useful when building various bioinformatics-related tools
                     and utilities.
                     .
                     Current list of features includes: a Sequence data type supporting
                     protein and nucleotide sequences and conversion between them, quality
                     data, reading and writing Fasta formatted files, reading TwoBit and
                     phd formats.  Rudimentary support for doing alignments - including
                     dynamic adjustment of scores based on sequence quality - and Blast
                     output parsing.  Partly implemented single linkage clustering, and
		     multiple alignment.  Reading Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (GOA) and
		     definitions\/hierarchy.

Tested-With:         GHC==6.8.2
Build-Type:          Simple
Build-Depends:       base>3, QuickCheck<2, binary, tagsoup>=0.4, bytestring >= 0.9.1,
                     containers, array, parallel, parsec, random, old-time, mtl
-- add fps for ghc 6.4.2; change imports in Bio/Sequence/TwoBit.hs if you want QC 2

-- We omit the debian/ and Test/ files because those are for development, not installation.
