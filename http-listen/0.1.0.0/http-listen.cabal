name:                http-listen
version:             0.1.0.0
x-revision: 2
synopsis:            Listen to HTTP requests and handle them in arbitrary ways.
description:
  In HTTP connections, there is a client side which sends requests (such as GET
  and POST), and a server side which receives and parses them. Often, the
  server side is a web server which responds to requests by sending some HTML
  pages back. But sometimes it's just a listener.
  .
  For example, a Git server may offer web hooks. It could send a POST request
  whenever a commit is made, or a new repository is created. You then set up a
  program that listens to these POSTs and reacts by reporting them to the
  project's IRC channel or a mailing list.
  .
  Most HTTP packages assume a typical web server which handles requests by
  returning HTTP responses. This package tries to fill a gap by providing an
  API for simple listeners which don't necessarily serve web pages, and can do
  things like reporting to IRC.
  .
  Some features are missing and will be added soon:
  .
  * Connection timeouts
  .
  * Logging (currently errors are written to stdout, no other logging done)
