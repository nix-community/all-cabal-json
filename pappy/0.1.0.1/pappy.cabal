Synopsis:            Packrat parsing; linear-time parsers for grammars in TDPL.
Description:         Packrat parsing is a novel and practical
                     method for implementing linear-time parsers
                     for grammars defined in Top-Down Parsing
                     Language (TDPL). While TDPL was originally
                     created as a formal model for top-down
                     parsers with backtracking capability, this
                     thesis extends TDPL into a powerful
                     general-purpose notation for describing
                     language syntax, providing a compelling
                     alternative to traditional context-free
                     grammars (CFGs). Common syntactic idioms
                     that cannot be represented concisely in a
                     CFG are easily expressed in TDPL, such as
                     longest-match disambiguation and "syntactic
                     predicates," making it possible to describe
                     the complete lexical and grammatical syntax
                     of a practical programming language in a
                     single TDPL grammar.

                     Packrat parsing is an adaptation of a
                     30-year-old tabular parsing algorithm that
                     was never put into practice until now. A
                     packrat parser can recognize any string
                     defined by a TDPL grammar in linear time,
                     providing the power and flexibility of a
                     backtracking recursive descent parser
                     without the attendant risk of exponential
                     parse time. A packrat parser can recognize
                     any LL(k) or LR(k) language, as well as many
                     languages requiring unlimited lookahead that
                     cannot be parsed by shift/reduce
                     parsers. Packrat parsing also provides
                     better composition properties than LL/LR
                     parsing, making it more suitable for dynamic
                     or extensible languages. The primary
                     disadvantage of packrat parsing is its
                     storage cost, which is a constant multiple
                     of the total input size rather than being
                     proportional to the nesting depth of the
                     syntactic constructs appearing in the input.

                     Monadic combinators and lazy evaluation
                     enable elegant and direct implementations of
                     packrat parsers in recent functional
                     programming languages such as Haskell. Three
                     different packrat parsers for the Java
                     language are presented here, demonstrating
                     the construction of packrat parsers in
                     Haskell using primitive pattern matching,
                     using monadic combinators, and by automatic
                     generation from a declarative parser
                     specification. The prototype packrat parser
                     generator developed for the third case
                     itself uses a packrat parser to read its
                     parser specifications, and supports full
                     TDPL notation extended with "semantic
                     predicates," allowing parsing decisions to
                     depend on the semantic values of other
                     syntactic entities. Experimental results
                     show that all of these packrat parsers run
                     reliably in linear time, efficiently support
                     "scannerless" parsing with integrated
                     lexical analysis, and provide the
                     user-friendly error-handling facilities
                     necessary in practical applications.
