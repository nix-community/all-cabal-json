Version:       0.0.2
Synopsis:      A zipper-like comonad which works as a list, tracking a position.
Category:      Data
Description:
    A PointedList tracks the position in a non-empty list which works similarly
    to a zipper. A current item is always required, and therefore the list may
    never be empty.
