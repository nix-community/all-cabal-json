Synopsis:       Efficient Matrix operations in 100% Haskell.
Description:    Efficient Matrix operations in 100% Haskell.
                .
                [@v0.1@] Initial version, features @det@,
                    basic arithmetic operations, and instances for
                    'Float', 'Double', 'Complex', and 'Rational'.
                .
                [@v0.1.1@] Fixed wrong algorithm for computing the
                    inverse of a 'Matrix'.
                .
                [@v0.1.2@] Added instances for @Num Matrix@,
                    @Fractional Matrix@, and @Eq Matrix@.
                .
                [@v0.1.3@] @inv@ is now a total function and will
                    no longer call `error' if a matrix is not
                    invertible. Also @Matrix@ derives 'Data.Typeable'
                    now.
                .
                [@v0.1.4@] Added @scale@, @<->@, and @<|>@. Corrected
                    a bug in @isUnit@ reported by Charles Durham
                    (would have returned True for any matrix for which
                    @all (== 1) . trace@ would have, which is wrong).
