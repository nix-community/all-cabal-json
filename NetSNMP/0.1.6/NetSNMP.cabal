Name:               NetSNMP
Version:            0.1.6
Synopsis:           Bindings for net-snmp's C API for clients
Description:        Network.Protocol.NetSNMP is a partial binding to the
                    library portion of the net-snmp package.  It uses the
                    'single-session api', which is claimed to be
                    thread-safe.  Not all operations are supported yet;
                    please contact the maintainer if you're in need of
                    expanded functionality, and especially if you would
                    like to contribute.
