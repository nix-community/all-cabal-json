synopsis:            Layout text as grid or table.

description:         
    `table-layout` is a library for text-based table layout, it provides several
    functions which help in this task from the ground up, although using them is
    not necessary. It provides the following layout features:
    .
    * Fixed-size and arbitrarily sized columns
    .
    * Positional alignment of content
    .
    * Alignment of text at a character occurence
    .
    * Cut marks show that text has been trimmed
    .
    * Building fancy tables with optional headers and user styles
    .
    * Layout text justified over multiple rows
