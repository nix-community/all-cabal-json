synopsis:            Educational drawing canvas for FP explorers.
description:         This package is an experimental teaching tool that
                     provides the foundation for presenting functional
                     idioms with graphical metaphors. The OpenGL canvas
                     boilerplate is abstracted away to a simple interface,
                     which allows to focus on program logic instead of the
                     graphics API. It's also arguably fun.
