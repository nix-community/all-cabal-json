synopsis:      An implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
description:   The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative
               technique that finds a local minimum of a function that
               is expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear
               functions. It has become a standard technique for
               nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of
               as a combination of steepest descent and the
               Gauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far
               from the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a
               steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to
               converge. When the current solution is close to the
               correct solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.
               .
               Optional box- and linear constraints can be given. Both
               single and double precision floating point types are
               supported.
               .
               The actual algorithm is implemented in a C library
               which is bundled with bindings-levmar which this
               package depends on. See:
               <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/>.
               .
               This library consists of two layers:
               .
               * LevMar.Intermediate: A medium-level layer that wraps
                 the low-level functions from bindings-levmar to
                 provide a more Haskell friendly interface.
               .
	       * LevMar: A high-level layer that uses type-level
                 programming to add extra type safety.
               .
               Each layer also has special data-fitting variants:
               .
	       * LevMar.Intermediate.Fitting
               .
               * LevMar.Fitting
               .
	       All modules are self-contained; i.e. each module
	       re-exports all the things you need to work with it.
	       .
	       For an example how to use this library see Demo.hs
	       which is included in this package. Demo.hs is a Haskell
	       translation of lmdemo.c from the C levmar library.
	       .
