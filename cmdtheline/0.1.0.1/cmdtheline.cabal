Name: cmdtheline
Version: 0.1.0.1
Synopsis: Declaritive command-line option parsing and documentation library.
Description:
  CmdTheLine aims to remove tedium from the definition of command-line
  programs, producing usage, help and man pages with little effort.
  .
  The inspiration was found in Daniel Bunzli's
  <http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner> library.
  .
  CmdTheLine uses applicative functors to provide a declarative, compositional
  mechanism for defining command-line programs by lifting regular Haskell
  functions over argument parsers.
  .
  Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are appreciated. Please see the
  bug and issue tracker at <http://github.com/eli-frey/cmdtheline>.
