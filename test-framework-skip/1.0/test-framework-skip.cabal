Synopsis:      Functions for conveniently marking some of the tests in a suite as being skipped.
Description:   When tracking down a problem it can often be useful to temporarily disable
               some or many of the tests in a suite so that one can focus on the problematic
               tests.  Rather than using a mess of comments, this module provides a
               function 'skip' (and a few variants) that causses a test or an entire test
               suite to be skipped - specifically, they will still show up in the suite
               as being 'skipped', but they will not be run.
