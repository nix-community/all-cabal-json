                    This package is a simple adaptation of ieee-utils, but compilable by ghc >= 7.
                    Unfortunately, MK had no response from the mainainer of ieee-utils, despite trying 
                    to make contact for over 2 years.  MK plans to deprecate this package when I find out that
                    ieee-utils is fixed or deprecated.
