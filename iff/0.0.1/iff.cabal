Synopsis:         Constructing and dissecting IFF files
Description:
  The Interchange File Format of Electronic Arts is a container format used for many kinds of data.
  Common file formats are
  e.g. IFF-8SVX for 8-bit sampled sounds and
  IFF-ILBM for images in an interleaved way that is close to image representation in Amiga computers.
  Cf. <http://netghost.narod.ru/gff/vendspec/iff/index.htm>
  This library does only handle the IFF container format
  and does not handle any specific IFF data type.
  The intention is the same as of Amiga's @iffparse.library@.
