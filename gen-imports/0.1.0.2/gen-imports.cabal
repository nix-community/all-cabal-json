synopsis:            Code to generate instances for the package "ghc-instances"
description:
  Functions in this package look at the hackage database to get all the public modules of packages.
  .
  It then creates Haskell files containing each module as an import statement.
  .
  It's primary purpose is to produce files for the
  package [ghc-instances](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-instances).
  See that package for the motivation behind this.
