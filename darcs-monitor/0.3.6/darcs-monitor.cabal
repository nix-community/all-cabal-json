Synopsis: Darcs repository monitor (sends email)
Description: Darcs-monitor will send email to a specified recipient
 about new changes added to a specific darcs repository. It can be run
 as an apply posthook (resulting in near-instantaneous "push"
 emails), or periodically from Cron, or occasionally by hand, whatever
 seems most convenient.
