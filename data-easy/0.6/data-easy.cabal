synopsis:            Consistent set of utility functions for Maybe, Either, List, Monoids.
description:         Easy to use set of utility functions, implementing a Data.Maybe like
                     interface for other common types, like Either, List, Bool, Tuple, 
                     or even member of the Monoid type class.
                     Also features a set of conversion functions among them, 
                     using sensible defaults.
