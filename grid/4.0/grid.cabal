name:           grid
version:        4.0
synopsis:       Tools for working with regular grids (graphs, lattices).
description:    Provides tools for working with regular arrangements
                of tiles, such as might be used in a board game or some
                other type of grid map. Currently supports triangular,
                square, and hexagonal tiles, with various 2D and 
                toroidal layouts.
                The userguide is available at 
                <https://github.com/mhwombat/grid/wiki>.
                .
                NOTE: Version 4.0 uses associated (type) synonyms
                instead of multi-parameter type classes.
                .
                NOTE: Version 3.0 changed the order of parameters
                for many functions. This makes it easier for the user
                to write mapping and folding operations.
