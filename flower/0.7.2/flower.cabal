Synopsis:       Analyze 454 flowgrams  (.SFF files)
Description:    flower - FLOWgram ExtractoR tools
		.
		This is now obsolete, please install the biosff library 
		(which includes the 'flower' exectuable) instead.
                .
                The flower executable reads files in SFF-format and produces various output, 
                including sequences with quality, or flowgram data in tabular format.  By default,
                it outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like
                'sffinfo' from Roche does.
                .
                The flowselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new
                SFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various quality criteria.
		.
		The flowt program removes (artificial) duplicates from SFF files.  It's currently a work
		in progress, but included if you'd like to play with it.  It's faster than other approaches 
		(e.g. CD-HIT), and ought to be more sensitive and specific, but this needs to be proven.
