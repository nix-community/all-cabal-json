synopsis: Tool to maintain a database of CABAL packages and their dependencies
description:
    Helper tool for people maintaining a set of CABAL packages for their
    distribution. It maintains a database of packages and verifies dependencies
    of the entire set as packages are added or updated. It also makes it trivial
    to track packages as new versions are released on Hackage.

    It can also be used to build source packages for the Arch Linux
    distribution.
