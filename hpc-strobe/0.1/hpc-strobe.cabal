Description:        A rudimentary library that demonstrates the
                    possibility of using Hpc (Haskell Program Coverage)
                    to inspect the state of a running Haskell program.
                    Use of the library involves a simple change of the
                    main function and also requires the program to be
                    enabled for hpc. At the time of writing, this means
                    using a fairly recent version of GHC and compiling
                    the Haskell code with the @-fhpc@ option.

-- Note: Checking the package on
-- http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/upload.html reports:
--
--   Exposed modules use unallocated top-level names: Trace
--
-- I feel somewhat justified in keeping this name, since the hpc
-- package itself uses Trace.Hpc.Tix and Trace.Hpc.Reflect. But I am
-- certainly open to suggested alternative names.
