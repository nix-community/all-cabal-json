name:           data-forest
version:        0.1.0.4
synopsis:       A simple multi-way tree data structure.

description:    In some contexts, forests (collections of zero or more trees) are more important than trees. The /data-forest/ library provides a @Tree@ type much like the one from the popular /containers/ library, but it also provides a @Forest@ type with its own @Functor@ and @Foldable@ instances.
