Cabal-Version: >= 1.6

Name:        Coadjute
Version:     0.1.1
Homepage:    http://iki.fi/matti.niemenmaa/coadjute/
Synopsis:    A generic build tool
Category:    Development
Stability:   experimental
Description:
   Coadjute is a generic build tool, intended as an easier to use and more
   portable replacement for make. It's not tailored toward any particular
   language, and is not meant to replace tools which target a specific
   environment.
   .
   Portability is striven towards in two ways:
     - You don't have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of many make implementations
       (well, people don't, but they call their GNU Make files makefiles
       instead of GNUmakefiles, which causes misunderstandings).
     - You have Haskell at your disposal, and are encouraged to use that
       whenever possible instead of system-specific binaries like the POSIX
       commands we all know and love.
   .
   With support for:
     - Parallel task performing.
     - Advanced out-of-dateness detection:
        - Choice between timestamps and hashes.
        - Keeping track of what arguments have been passed.
     - Haskell!
