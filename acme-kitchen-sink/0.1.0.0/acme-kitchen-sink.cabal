synopsis:            A place for dumping that does-not-feel-right code while you improve it
description:
            Do you have code you feel that should be shared on some library, but
            can't pin down on how it should be named, or structured? Are you
            reusing tools that you are uncertain if optimal, or even if they solve
            the right problem? Does everything seem in place, aligned, within
            reach, and yeat you just can't grab that bird?
            .
            If so, this package is for you.
            .
            Drop here any code you think may be valuable, and refrain from depending
            on this package. If anything here is useful for you, copy into your
            project and subscribe to the respective issue.
            .
            See the README for more details.
