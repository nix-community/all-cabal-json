name:                netwire-input
version:             0.0.6
synopsis:            Input handling abstractions for netwire
description:         This package contains a collection of Monad typeclasses that
                     support interaction with input devices such as keyboard and
                     mice. Moreover, these typeclasses are used to create wires from
                     the netwire package the produce mouse and keyboard input values
                     in a reactive way. This package cannot be used independently
                     and must be used with another package that provides instantiation
                     of these typeclasses such as netwire-input-glfw.
