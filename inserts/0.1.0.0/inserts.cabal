synopsis:            Stupid simple bytestring templates.
description:         
  A template library that has two functions and a type in its API.
  .
  Sometimes you need a powerful template library which allows for looping and
  conditional evaluation, deserialization from nearly every standard Haskell
  type, and manipulation of contexts abstractly. In those cases, I suggest
  @hastache@.
  .
  Sometimes you just need to inserts @ByteString@s into other @ByteString@s.
  In those cases, I suggest this library.
