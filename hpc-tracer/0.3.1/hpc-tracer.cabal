Synopsis:	Tracer with AJAX interface
description:
    An incomplete component of the Hpc toolkit which provides the
    ability to step through coverage ticks as they happen, giving a
    poor mans debugger.  Requires the binary being traced to be build
    using a specific version of ghc-6.7, so YMWV.

    The plan is to port this to the new GHC API, giving both tracing
    and free variable examination via an Ajax interface.
