description:  This package provides a safe and convenient wrapper around
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foreign-store foreign-store>
    for hot-reloadable background threads during a GHCi session, useful
    for the development of long-running programs like servers, web
    applications and interactive user interfaces.
    .
    It can also be used in the context of batch-style programs to keep
    resources that are expensive to create in memory instead of having
    to recreate them after every module reload.
