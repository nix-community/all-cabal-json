Synopsis:            Type-safe replacement for System.FilePath etc
Description:         This package provides type-safe access to filepath manipulations.
		     .
		     "System.Path" is designed to be used instead of "System.FilePath".
		     (It is intended to provide versions of functions from that
		     module which have equivalent functionality but are more
		     typesafe). "System.Path.Directory" is a companion module
		     providing a type-safe alternative to "System.Directory".
		     .
		     The heart of this module is the @'Path' ar fd@ abstract type which
		     represents file and directory paths. The idea is that there are
		     two phantom type parameters - the first should be 'Abs' or 'Rel',
		     and the second 'File' or 'Dir'. A number of type synonyms are
		     provided for common types:
		     .
		     > type AbsFile     = Path Abs File
		     > type RelFile     = Path Rel File
		     > type AbsDir      = Path Abs Dir
		     > type RelDir      = Path Rel Dir
		     >
		     > type AbsPath  fd = Path Abs fd
		     > type RelPath  fd = Path Rel fd
		     > type FilePath ar = Path ar File
		     > type DirPath  ar = Path ar Dir
		     .
		     The type of the 'combine' (aka '</>') function gives the idea:
		     .
		     > (</>) :: DirPath ar -> RelPath fd -> Path ar fd
		     .
		     Together this enables us to give more meaningful types to
		     a lot of the functions, and (hopefully) catch a bunch more
		     errors at compile time.
		     .
		     Overloaded string literals are supported, so with the @OverloadedStrings@
		     extension enabled, you can:
		     .
		     > f :: FilePath ar
		     > f = "tmp" </> "someFile" <.> "ext"
		     .
		     If you don't want to use @OverloadedStrings@, you can use the construction fns:
		     .
		     > f :: FilePath ar
		     > f = asDirPath "tmp" </> asFilePath "someFile" <.> "ext"
		     .
		     or...
		     .
		     > f :: FilePath ar
		     > f = asPath "tmp" </> asPath "someFile" <.> "ext"
		     .
		     or just...
		     .
		     > f :: FilePath ar
		     > f = asPath "tmp/someFile.ext"
		     .
		     One point to note is that whether one of these is interpreted as
		     an absolute or a relative path depends on the type at which it is
		     used:
		     .
		     > *System.Path> f :: AbsFile
		     > /tmp/someFile.ext
		     > *System.Path> f :: RelFile
		     > tmp/someFile.ext
		     .
		     You will typically want to import as follows:
		     .
		     > import Prelude hiding (FilePath)
		     > import System.Path
		     > import System.Path.Directory
		     > import System.Path.IO
		     .
		     The basic API (and properties satisfied) are heavily influenced
		     by Neil Mitchell's "System.FilePath" module.
