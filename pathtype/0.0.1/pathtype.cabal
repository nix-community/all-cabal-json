Synopsis:            Type-safe replacement for System.FilePath etc
Description:         This module provides type-safe access to filepath manipulations.
                     .
		     It is designed to be imported instead of 'System.FilePath' and
		     'System.Directory' and is intended to provide versions of
		     functions from those modules which have equivalent functionality
		     but are more typesafe.
                     .
		     The heart of this module is the @Path ar fd@ abstract type which
		     represents file and directory paths. The idea is that there are
		     two phantom type parameters - the first should be 'Abs' or 'Rel',
		     and the second 'File' or 'Dir'. A number of type synonyms are
		     provided for common types:
                     .
                     > type AbsFile    = Path Abs File
                     > type RelFile    = Path Rel File
                     > type AbsDir     = Path Abs Dir
                     > type RelDir     = Path Rel Dir
                     > type RelPath fd = Path Rel fd
                     > type DirPath ar = Path ar Dir
                     .
		     The type of the 'combine' (aka '</>') function gives the idea:
                     .
		     > (</>) :: DirPath ar -> RelPath fd -> Path ar fd
                     .
		     Together this enables us to give more meaningful types to
		     a lot of the functions, and (hopefully) catch a bunch more
		     errors at compile time.
                     .
		     The basic API (and properties satisfied) are heavily influenced
		     by Neil Mitchell's 'System.FilePath' module.
                     .
		     WARNING -- THE API IS NOT YET STABLE -- WARNING
