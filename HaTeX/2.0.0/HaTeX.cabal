         Changes from last version:
         .
         * IMPORTANT: @LaTeXM@ monad has been replaced by @LaTeXT@ monadic transformer.
         So, change types of form @LaTeXM a@ (or @LaTeX@) to @LaTeXT m a@ (or @LaTeX m@).
         This allow you to use computations of any monad through a lift function.
         .
         * Function @iolx@ replaced by @mlx@.
         .
         * IMPORTANT: IO module has been removed.
         .
         * Added new documentation.
         .
         * Added new macros.
