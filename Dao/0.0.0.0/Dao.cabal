Synopsis: An interactive knowledge base, natural language interpreter.
Description:
        This program is still largely incomplete.
        Dao is an artificial intelligence program which allows users to construct
        a knowledge base for intepreting natural language input. The idea is to
        let users interactively build their own knowledge base by adding rules at
        runtime.  The state of the knowledge base can be updated by enacting it's
        own production rules, or by a user entering commands to alter the state
        directly. Regular-expression-like patterns are associated with rules so
        natural language input can be used to invoke rules at any time.
