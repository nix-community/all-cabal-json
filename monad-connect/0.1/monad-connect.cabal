synopsis: Transformer for TCP connection with TLS and SOCKS support
description:
    This library is a basic monadic wrapper over the @connection@ package. It
    provides a monad transformer which gives your monad stack the ability to
    maintain a single TCP connection, possibly over TLS and/or SOCKS.
    .
    This is very convenient for simple client applications which connect to a
    single server, but it is /not/ enough for robust applications which want to
    automatically reconnect on errors. In the latter case, a reconnection and
    error handling layer can be added on top of the simple transformer provided
    here.
