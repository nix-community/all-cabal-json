synopsis:      2 and 3 dimensional hash using Morton numbers.
description:   This library compute the Morton numbers in 2d and 3d. 
			   It transforms integers x, y to a single integer z.
               The hash z has the property : if (x, y) and (x2, y2) 
               are close then their Morton numbers are close.
