Synopsis:       A quasiquoter for haskell-src-exts.
Description:
    Allows one to write programs that generate Haskell programs much
    more concisely and legibly. This package supports:
    .
    * Antiquotations, denoted by stealing the splice syntax of
    Template Haskell, for example @[$hs| $x ++ $(Hs.strE "bar") |]@.
    Splices may not nested.
    .
    * Antiquoting names in patterns. Names that are antiquoted appear
    surrounded by double parentheses. For instance:
    .
    > let f = Hs.name "foo" in [$hs| ((f)) x = x + x |]
