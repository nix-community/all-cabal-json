synopsis:            Typelevel balanced search trees via a singletonized Data.Map
description:         This package provides a typelevel balanced search tree based on an ancient version of Data.Map, 
                     originating from the uulib package. I used this older version as it uses relatively "simple"
                     Haskell, and thus is singletonized relatively straightforwardly.
