description:
    ParserFunction provides utilities for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. The central parsing
    function in this package is @stringToExpr@, which parses a string-expression and returns a maybe expression tree.
    This tree is suitable for performing symbolic manipulation. Expressions can then be evaluated using the function
    @evalExpr@. If you wish to evaluate a string-expression without any intermediate operations, simply use the function
    @evalString@. Examples of these functions can be seen by viewing the source code of this module.
