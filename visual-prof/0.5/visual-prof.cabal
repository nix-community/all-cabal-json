Synopsis:               Create a visual profile of a program's source code
Description:
    visual-prof profiles your Haskell program and generates a html file containing
    its source code with parts of the code highlighted in different
    colors depending on the fraction of the running time that they take.
    visual-prof gives you an easy way to find places for optimization in your code.
    .
    Usage:
    .
    > visual-prof -px A/B/C.hs run "arg1 arg2"
    .
    This will profile the C.hs file used by run.hs which contains the Main module
    of your project. Arguments to ./run are passed as shown (arg1, arg2,...). The parameters
    should be given in that order.
    .
    The simplest way to run it is:
    .
    > visual-prof -px test.hs test
    .
    which will generate a profile for the file test.hs (which needs to have a main function)
