Name:                mvclient
Version:             0.1.1
Synopsis:            Client library for metaverse systems like Second Life
Description:         This implements the client side of connections to virtual world environments
                     like Linden Labs' Second Life or OpenSim (http://opesimulator.org), sometimes
                     known as the "metaverse".
                     .
                     Because of the lack of SSL implementations for Haskell, you currently need
                     to set up stunnel for initial login step for worlds (like Second Life) that
                     use secure login pages.
