Version:             0.2
Synopsis:            Client library for metaverse systems like Second Life
Description:         The client side of connections to virtual world environments
                     like Linden Labs' Second Life or OpenSim
                     (<http://opensimulator.org>), sometimes known as the
                     "metaverse".
                     .
                     Note that due to the lack of SSL implementations for
                     Haskell, you currently need to set up stunnel for initial
                     login step for worlds (like Second Life) that use secure
                     login pages.  This is also the main obstacle to an
                     implementation of the caps system.
