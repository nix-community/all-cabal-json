Name:                mvclient
Version:             0.3
Synopsis:            Client library for metaverse systems like Second Life
Description:         The client side of connections to virtual world environments
                     like Linden Labs' Second Life, sometimes known as the
                     "metaverse".
                     .
                     As of version 0.3, no longer requires an stunnel proxy for
                     connecting to Second Life.  Thanks for Michael Snoyman and
                     his http-enumerator package!
