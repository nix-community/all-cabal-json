Name:         xcb-types
Version:      0.1.0
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.2
Synopsis:     Parses XML files used by the XCB project
Description:   This package provides types which mirror the structures
  used in the XCB code generation XML files.

  See project http://xcb.freedesktop.org/ for more information about the XCB
  project.

  The XML files describe the data-types, events and requests used by the
  X Protocol, and are used to auto-generate large parts of the XCB project.

 This package parses these XML files into Haskell data structures.

  If you want to do something with these XML descriptions but don't want
  to learn XSLT, this package should help.
