Synopsis:            XML parser and renderer with HTML 5 quirks mode
Description:         Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5
                     document fragments, which share data structures wo that
                     it's easy to work with both.  Document fragments are bits
                     of documents, which are not constrained by some of the
                     high-level structure rules (in particular, they may
                     contain more than one root element).
                     .
                     Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser.  Rather,
                     it is a parser for HTML 5 compliant documents.  It does not
                     implement the HTML 5 parsing algorithm, and should
                     generally be expected to perform correctly only on
                     documents that you trust to conform to HTML 5.  This is
                     not a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or
                     other software that will be exposed to documents from
                     outside sources.  The result is also not the HTML 5
                     node structure, but rather something closer to the physical
                     structure.  For example, omitted start tags are not
                     inserted (and so, their corresponding end tags must also be
                     omitted).
