synopsis:            FFI bindings to the Xen Control library.
description:         FFI bindings to xenctrl.h and perhaps more.
                     The System.Xen.CBindings should provide direct access
                     to the C API while System.Xen will eventually provide
                     a higher level abstraction.  This library binding
                     allows pure haskell programs to use XenCtrl functions;
                     these can be Haskell versions of xend, xm, and
                     virt-manager but more interesting projects are possible.
                     Think about a happs app controlling domains and complex
                     policy controls on resource (CPU, memory, PCI) uses.
