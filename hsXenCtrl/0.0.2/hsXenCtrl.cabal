name:                hsXenCtrl
version:             0.0.2
synopsis:            FFI bindings to the Xen Control library.
description:         FFI bindings to xenctrl.h and perhaps more.
                     This is an early (incomplete) release, but in general
                     the System.Xen.CBindings should provide direct access
                     to the C API while System.Xen will eventually provide
                     a higher level abstraction.
