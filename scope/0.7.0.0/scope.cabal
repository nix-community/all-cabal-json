Name:                scope

Version:             0.7.0.0

Synopsis:            An interactive renderer for plotting time-series data

Description:
    scope is a framework for plotting time-series data, using zoom-cache
    files.
    .
    This version includes a Gtk/Cairo application. It's a desktop
    application with a /File/ menu; remember those? wow! This will probably
    be split out into a separate package later, and there'll be a webby
    javascripty version too, but for now there's this desktop app.
    .
    To run it, simply:
    .
    @
        $ cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools scope
        $ scope
    @
    .
    Then, select /File->Open/ from the menubar, with your mouse: there's no
    swiping gestures back here, baby! Four (yes, 4) demo files are included
    in this version of the package. Choose one, and it will be drawn in the
    window. Amazing! It should look something like what you saw in the post
    you read about this in, but more personal because now it's happening to
    you.
    .
    Zoom in with the scroll wheel on your mouse. If you don't have a scroll
    wheel, use the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard. If you don't have
    up and down arrows /you are elite/!
    .
    Pan around by dragging it. There's a scrollbar too if you're into that.
    .
    Load up another file! It will also be drawn. Zoom in and out and pan
    around, yay! Life is gooood!
