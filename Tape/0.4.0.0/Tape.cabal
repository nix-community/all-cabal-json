version:             0.4.0.0
synopsis:            Bidirectionally infinite streams, akin to the tape of a Turing machine.
description:         This module implements two-way infinite streams with a focused element, akin to a Turing machine's tape. This structure is also known by the name of a list zipper (although in this case it's a list zipper with the additional criterion that the list is infinite in both directions).
