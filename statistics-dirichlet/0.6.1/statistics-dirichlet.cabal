Synopsis:            Functions for working with Dirichlet densities and mixtures on vectors.

Description:
    Functions for working with Dirichlet densities and mixtures
    on vectors.  The focus of this package is on deriving these
    distributions from observed data.
    .
    This package should be treated as experimental code, it has
    not been battle-tested as much as it would be nice to be.
    .
    Note that although this package is BSD3-licensed, it uses the
    @nonlinear-optimization@ package which is GPLed.  It should
    be straightforward to use another library in its stead,
    though.
