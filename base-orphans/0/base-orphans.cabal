name:                base-orphans
version:             0
synopsis:            Backwards-compatible orphan instances for base
description:         @base-orphans@ defines orphan instances that mimic instances available in later versions of @base@ to a wider (older) range of compilers. @base-orphans@ does not export anything except the orphan instances themselves and complements @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat base-compat>@.
                     `base-orphans-0` is an intentional empty release. For an explanation as to why it exists, see the <https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-orphans/tree/base-orphans-0#readme README>.
