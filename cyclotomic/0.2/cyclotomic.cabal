Name:                cyclotomic
Version:             0.2
Synopsis:            A subfield of the complex numbers for exact calculation
Description:         The cyclotomic numbers are a subset of the
                     complex numbers with a number of nice properties.
                     They are represented exactly, enabling exact
                     computations and equality comparisons.  They
                     contain the Gaussian rationals (complex numbers
                     of the form p + q i with p and q rational).  The
                     cyclotomic numbers contain the square roots of
                     all rational numbers.  They contain the sine and
                     cosine of all rational multiples of pi.
