Synopsis:       A preprocessor for expanding "ixdo" notation for indexed monads
Build-type:     Simple
Description:
        This preprocessor expands a Haskell program using "ixdo" notation
        into a Haskell program using the indexed monad bind operator
        (>>>=).  It also serves as an example for the preprocessor-tools
        package.
        .
        While GHC 6.10 can now expand do-notation when (>>=) is rebound
        at a non-standard type, this makes it difficult to use
        do-notation for both monads and custom monad-like structures in
        the same compilation module.  This preprocessor makes it easy to
        use do-like syntax for indexed monads while retaining "do" for
        monads.
        .
        If installed in ~/.cabal, then ~/.cabal/bin must be in the path
        for GHC to find it from a -pgmF flag.
