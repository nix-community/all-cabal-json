synopsis:            Infix expression re-parsing (for HsParser library)
description:         The Haskell parser does not consider the fixity
                     of operators when parsing infix applications.
                     All infix applications are thus parsed as
                     if the operators were all left associative with
                     the same precedence.

                     This module contains code for re-parsing infix
                     applications taking into account the fixity of
                     operators.

                     The important algorithm is the well known
                     operator precedence parsing algorithm. See
                     comments in the code for more detailed
                     information.
