description:
  .
  A catalogue of the combinator birds (Data.Aviary.Birds etc.) - 
  these modules are intended for illustration and-or reference
  (i.e. looking up combinators by their type signature).
  .
  Using @Data.Aviary@ as a library (i.e. depending on it for 
  other packages) is not recommended: combinator-mania leads to 
  inscrutable code.
  .
