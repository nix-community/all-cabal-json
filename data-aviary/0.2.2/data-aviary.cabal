synopsis:         Combinator birds.
description:
  A catalogue of the combinator birds (Data.Aviary.Birds) - this 
  module is intended more for illustration than utility.
  .
  (Data.Aviary.Functional) operations from Applicative, Monad 
  etc. with their types specialized to the function type. This 
  might be usefulfor /bird-watching/ i.e. spotting instances 
  where an Applicative, Monad or whatever operation corresponds 
  to a combinator bird. Again this module is not intended for 
  actual use.
  . 
  Plus a smaller set (Data.Aviary) intended to be useful, 
  collecting combinators that have already /escaped/ (published 
  elsewhere) but aren\'t in Data.Function, along with some 
  personal favourites.
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.2.2 added Data.Aviary.Functional - Applicative, Monad etc.
        signatures specialized to the function type. 
  .
  0.2.1 added @dup@ and the /combiner/ variants of cardinal-prime.
  .
  0.2.0 added Haddock docs for @(\#\#)@.
