Name:                theta-functions
Version:             1.0.1
Cabal-version:       >= 1.6
Synopsis:            Theta-functions implemented as trigonometric series

Description:
  Small and simple library for computing values of Theta functions.
  They're the special functions of two variables. Described very well at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_function>.
  Library exports four theta-functions and a small helper to calculate their second parameter.
  Theta functions are functions of Complex variables, FYI.
