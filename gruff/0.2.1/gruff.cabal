Name:                gruff
Version:             0.2.1
Synopsis:            fractal explorer GUI using the ruff library
Description:
    Mandelbrot Set fractal explorer using the ruff library.
    .
    Requires GTK, OpenGL, and GLSL fragment shader support; lots of RAM
    and multiple CPU cores recommended.  If you want to explore very deep
    zooms, you'll need hmpfr which currently requires GHC to be compiled
    with integer-simple instead of the default integer-gmp.  To install
    without MPFR support, use @cabal install gruff -f-mpfr@.
    .
    This version is a bugfix release.  Changes since gruff-0.2:
    .
      * Supersampling bugs are fixed (no more undocumented quantization
        leading to inconsistent appearance at different zoom levels).
    .
      * Race condition bugs in cache management are fixed (no more
        incompletely rendered images).
    .
      * Internal changes/refactoring to make future additions easier.
    .
    Features in this version include:
    .
      * Interactive fractal browser display (left click to zoom in,
        right click to zoom out, middle-click to center).
    .
      * Session persistance (stored in @~\/.gruff\/state.gruff@ - states can
        also be loaded from and saved to other files).
    .
      * Tile cache (by default in @~\/.gruff\/cache@ - symlink it somewhere
        with a few GB of space if you plan on exploring a lot).
    .
      * High-level feature finding using angled internal addresses
        (enter an address, for example @1 2 3 1/3 10@, and hit return,
        then click the adjacent Go button).
    .
      * Feature finding using period location (navigate to approximate
        location of the desired feature, click the Scan button).
    .
      * Angled internal address calculation using reverse ray trace
        (navigate to approximate feature location, click the Scan+ button).
    .
      * Uses MPFR where available for higher precision, allowing deeper
        zooms and locating high period nucleii.
    .
      * Limited amount of customizable colouring (colours for interior,
        border, and exterior points).
    .
      * Supersampling for more detailed images (useful range is 1 to 16).
    .
    Future features might include image saving, external ray and feature
    information overlays, more feature finding and identification
    algorithms, scripting support for rendering animations, ...
