-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         
 pcre-light utility functions for more user friendly usage.
 Instead of adding execution and compile options to the matching and
 compiling functions, the options are added to the regular expression to be
 compiled or run. Furthermore support for different matching return types
 (using typeclass 'MatchResult') and different regular expression types
 (compiled or uncompiled using typeclass 'RegexLike') are supported. See module
 documentation for examples.
