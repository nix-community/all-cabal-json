Description: 
    Common debugging/error/exception functions that give file location information
    .
    > $(err "OH NO!")
    >
    > main:Main main.hs:16:1 OH NO!
    .
    Notice how it displays package:module file:line:character
    It exposes the functions err (error), undef (undefined), and trc (Debug.Trace.trace). All of these behave the same as their normal counterpart but also spit out a location.
    .
    I also included my favorite helper, debug, which is like trace but just show the value.
    .
    > debug [1,2,3]
    >
    > DEBUG: [1,2,3]
    > [1,2,3]
    .
    And The Template Haskell version.
    .
    > $(dbg) [1,2,3]
    >
    > DEBUG main:Main main.hs:1:3 [1,2,3]
    > [1,2,3]
    .
