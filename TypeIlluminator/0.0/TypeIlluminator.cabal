synopsis:            TypeIlluminator is a prototype tool exploring debugging of type errors/
description:         TypeIlluminator is a prototype tool implementing the ideas presented in the paper
                     Compositional Explanation of Types and Algorithmic Debugging of Type Errors.
                     It constructs the type explanation graph for programs written in a simple
                     Haskell-like language and enables free navigation through the graph
                     in various ways and algorithmic debugging.
