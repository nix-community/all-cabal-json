Name:              local-search 
Version:           0.0.6
Synopsis:          Generalised local search within Haskell, for applications in combinatorial optimisation. 
Description:       This library operates by representing metaheuristics as generators of solutions, or 
                   streams of solutions, which are themselves the result of resolving the interactions of 
                   other streams of values. The library contains combinators for constructing and 
                   managing these structures.     
Stability:         experimental
