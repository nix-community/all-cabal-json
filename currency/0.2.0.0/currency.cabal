synopsis:        Types representing standard and non-standard currencies
description:
        This package provides two types for representing currencies, one that
        can only represent ISO4217 currencies, and one that can also represent
        nonstandard currencies.
        .
        An IsString instance is provided for convenience on the general type.
        .
        Instances of Eq, Ord, and, Hashable are provided for use as keys.
        .
        The Enum instance provides a mapping to/from ISO4217 numeric codes for
        currencies that have such a code.
