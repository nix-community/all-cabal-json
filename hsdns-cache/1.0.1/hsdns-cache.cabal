    .
    Caching asynchronous DNS resolver built on top of
    GNU ADNS <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/>.
    .
     * Resolves several IP addresses for one host (if available)
       in round-robin fashion.
    .
     * Limits number of parallel requests (so DNS resolving continues to work
       even under heavy load).
    .
     * Errors are cached too (for one minute).
    .
     * Handles CNAMEs (@hsdns@ returns error for them).
    .
    This cache is tested in a long running web-crawler
    (used in <http://bazqux.com>) so it should be safe to use it in real world
    applications.
