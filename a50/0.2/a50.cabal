Synopsis:       Compare genome assemblies
Description:    a50 - a simple tool for graphing genome coverage and fragmentation.
                .
                Reads files of contigs, and compares them by plotting each as a line in a graph. 
		The x-axis represents contig number, the y-axis represents total (cumulative) size.
		An ideal assembly contains a few, large contigs, thus this curve should rise steeply, and 
		stop early (but at the expected genome size).  Conversely, a poor assembly consisting of
		many small fragments will have a less steep curve extending far to the right.
		.
		The graphs produced by a50 gives a simple and easy to grasp comparison between assemblies,
		and yet produces a more detailed and informative view than the usual metrics like largest
		contig size or N50.
