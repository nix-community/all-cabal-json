Synopsis:           High-resolution clock and timer functions:
                    realtime, monotonic, cputime, etc.
Description:        A package for convenient access to high-resolution
                    clock and timer functions of different operating
                    systems.
                    .
                    It is planned to consist of two layers. The lower
                    layer will provide direct access to OS-specific
                    clock and timer functions like clock_gettime of
                    Posix or GetTickCount of Windows and its upper
                    layer shall then provide a common API for all
                    supported systems. Currently only the lower level
                    is being developed.
