synopsis: Concurrent over the network execution library
description: net-concurrent is a simple haskell library for doing parallel
             computation on several computers using the network. There is a
             single master process and many slave processes. Communication
             is between the master and the slaves, for simplicity slaves
             never communicate with each other.
             Communication is done using NVars, network variables.
             The NVar api is very similar to MVar. These are stored in the
             master process and shared between all processes in the system.
             Slave nodes can read and write these NVar variables which results
             in network transactions with the master.
