Name:                tup-functor
Version:             0.2.0.3
Synopsis:            Homogeneous tuples
Description:         Homogeneous tuples (also known as vectors), with various instances, most notably 'Functor' and 'Applicative'.
                     The primary goal of the library is to help functor-oriented programming  
                     (for low-dimensional linear algebra, there are more specific packages, eg. @vect@). 
                     A small preprocessor for a tuple syntax is also included. We also provide a different implementation 
                     using type-level programming.
