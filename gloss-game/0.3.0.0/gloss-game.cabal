Synopsis:               Gloss wrapper that simplifies writing games
Description:
  The game interface of the basic Gloss library combines frame-based rendering with user input into a simple 2D game API.
  Gloss.Game improves that API to make common tasks in game programming, such as, on demand image loading, animations, and
  event handler chains more convenient.
