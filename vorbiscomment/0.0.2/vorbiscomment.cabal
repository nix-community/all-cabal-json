Synopsis:            Reading of Vorbis comments from Ogg Vorbis files
Description:         This library supports reading of Vorbis comments from Ogg Vorbis files, and
                     will perhaps support writing of such comments in the future; as well as,
                     perhaps, reading/writing Vorbis comments to other file formats
                     (FLAC, Theora, etc).
