Name:                sink
Version:             0.1.0.0
Synopsis:            An alternative to lazy I/O that doesn't conflate
                     execution with evaluation
Description:         Lazy I/O conflates evaluation with execution; a
                     value obtained from 'unsafeInterleaveIO' can
                     perform side-effects during the evaluation of
                     pure code. Like lazy I/O, a 'Sink' provides a way
                     to obtain the value of the result of an 'IO'
                     action before the action has been executed, but
                     unlike lazy I/O, it does not enable pure code to
                     perform side-effects. Instead, the value is
                     explicitly assigned by a later 'IO' action.
