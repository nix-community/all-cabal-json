Name:                   cuda
Version:                0.6.0.0
Synopsis:               FFI binding to the CUDA interface for programming NVIDIA GPUs
Description:
    The CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming
    model for NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection
    of bindings to allow you to call and control, although not write, such
    functions from Haskell-land. You will need to install the CUDA driver and
    developer toolkit.
    .
    <http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>
    .
    The configure script will look for your CUDA installation in the standard
    places, and if the nvcc compiler is found in your PATH, relative to that.
    .
    This release is for version 6.0 of the CUDA toolkit.
