Name:                freesect
Version:             0.6
Synopsis:            A Haskell syntax extension for generalised sections.
Description:
    This package provides a preprocessor executable, \'freesect\', 
    which implements a generalisation of sections (\'free sections\')
    for partial application and higher-order style.  Some examples
    of free sections can be found in the included test suite; refer
    to the homepage for more info.

Extra-source-files:
  -- You may not make use of all of these ones:
  000-readme, Makefile, cln, freesect.sh, ile, z, zpack
  -- These are example modules containing free sections for testing:
  S14.hs, S15.hs, S23.hs, S24.hs, S25.hs, S26.hs
  -- Snapshot of documentation; visit the homepage for up-to-date versions:
  Doc/index.html, Doc/irc.html,
  -- The rest are critical for building freesect:
  FilesAndParsing.hs,
  -- Since HSE is not yet patched to include -XFreeSections, we need
  -- to build a patched version locally, hence these dependencies:
  HSE/InternalParser.ly,
  HSE.hs,
  HSE/Annotated.hs,
  HSE/Annotated/Build.hs,
  HSE/Annotated/ExactPrint.hs,
  HSE/Annotated/Fixity.hs,
