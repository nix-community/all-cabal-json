synopsis: The absorbing element of package dependencies
description:
  <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html Cabal>
  package dependencies form a commutative monoid with an absorbing element.
  They satisfy the following axioms:
  .
  [Associativity]
  .
  For all dependencies @a@, @b@ and @c@,
  .
  @
  (a , b) , c = a , (b , c)
  @
  .
  In fact, the Cabal syntax does not even allow you to use the parentheses for
  this reason.
  .
  [Commutativity]
  .
  For all dependencies @a@ and @b@,
  .
  @
  a , b = b , a
  @
  .
  [Identity element]
  .
  For all dependencies @a@,
  .
  @
  acme-one , a = a
  a , acme-one = a
  @
  .
  Depending on @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acme-one acme-one>@ has no
  additional effect.
  .
  [Absorbing element]
  .
  For all dependencies @a@,
  .
  @
  acme-zero , a = acme-zero
  a , acme-zero = acme-zero
  @
  .
  Depending on @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acme-zero acme-zero>@ in
  addition has the same effect as /only/ depending on @acme-zero@.
