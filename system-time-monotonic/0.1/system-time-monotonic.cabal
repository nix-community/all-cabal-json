synopsis:           Simple library for using the system's monotonic clock
description:
    Simple library for using the system's monotonic clock.  This library is
    geared toward programs that need to run for long periods of time.  It does
    not (necessarily) provide high-resolution timing.
    .
        * On Windows, this uses @GetTickCount64@, but falls back to
          @GetTickCount@ if it is not available.  @GetTickCount64@ was
          introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
          Support for @QueryPerformanceCounter@ is also available, but is not
          used by default, as it is less accurate in the long run than
          @GetTickCount@.
    .
        * On Linux, this uses @clock_gettime@ with @CLOCK_MONOTONIC@.
