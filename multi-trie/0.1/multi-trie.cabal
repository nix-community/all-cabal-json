description:
    A multi-trie is a trie (i.e. a tree whose child nodes have distinct labels)
    with each node containing a list of values.

    This data structure represents a structured many-valued naming: names are
    compound and form a monoid under concatenation; each name can have multiple
    values.
    
    Some operations could be defined for multi-tries in a rather natural way,
    including 'map', 'union', 'intersection', 'cartesian' product.
    
    Moreover, a multi-trie can contain not only ordinary values but also
    functions that makes it possible to apply a multi-trie of functions to a
    multi-trie of argument values. This makes 'MultiTrie' an instance of
    'Functor', 'Applicative' and 'Monad'.
