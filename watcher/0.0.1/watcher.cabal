Synopsis:      Opinionated filesystem watcher.
Description:   A thin opinionated wrapper around INotify. Fires
               Added/Changed/Moved/Removed events on files, and that's it.
               Watches (only files) recursively on a given directory.
               Designed for simple filesystem watchers that don't want to mess
               with INotify. Inherits all of INotify's limitations surrounding
               moved files: Events are not fired for overwritten files nor for
               files moved out of the watched directory.
