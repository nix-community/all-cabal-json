synopsis:            Object-oriented programming with singleton methods
                     and duck typing.
description:         This package provides Object-oriented programming 
                     found in dynamically-typed languages such as
                     python or ruby.
                     .
                     @Object@ is implemented as @Map@ from method keys
                     to values. Different keys can have different value types
                     .
