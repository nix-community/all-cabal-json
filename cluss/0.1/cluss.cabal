synopsis: simple alternative to type classes
description:
    A /cluss/ enables you to achieve /function overloading/, or ad-hoc polymorphism,
    without creating a new type class.
    .
    In order to give ad-hoc polymorphism to a type variable @a@,
    you simply use @In@ with a list of \"type patterns\" like @In [Type T, ...] a@,
    which indicates that the type matches some of the patterns;
    which is analogous to a type class indicating that a type matches some of its \"instances\".
    The constraint @In [Type T, ...] a@ is what we call a \"cluss\".
    .
    Cluss instances are /closed/ and cluss methods are /open/,
    unlike type classes, whose instances are open and whose methods are closed.
    .
    Clusses can easily be used in a nested way,
    and can even be /recursive/, just like recursive type classes,
    and therefore clusses are expressive enough to imitate Haskell-98-style type classes.
    .
    More information can be found in the Haddock or the comments in the source code.
