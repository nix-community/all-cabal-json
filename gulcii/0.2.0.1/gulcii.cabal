Name:               gulcii
Version:            0.2.0.1
Synopsis:           graphical untyped lambda calculus interactive interpreter
Description:
  GULCII is an untyped lambda calculus interpreter supporting interactive
  modification of a running program with graphical display of graph reduction.
  .
  There are three variants of lambda abstraction: lazy, strict, and copy:
  .
  @> \x . f x x    -- x is evaluated lazily with sharing@
  @> \x ! f x x    -- x is evaluated strictly and shared@
  @> \x ? f x x    -- x is copied before any evaluation@
  .
  There is additional syntax sugar for natural numbers and lists, using
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogensen%E2%80%93Scott_encoding#Scott_encoding>:
  .
  @> [0,1,2,3]@
  .
  There is a small standard library based loosely around the Haskell Prelude,
  with additions geared towards MIDI generation for live-coding music, implemented
  using a mechanism similar to 'Debug.Trace.trace':
  .
  @> \x y . &#123; print : x &#125; y@
  .
  Quick start:
  .
  > gulcii
  > :load mars.gu
  > main
  > :quit
  .
  If you have Pure-data and Timidity, try:
  .
  > timidity -iA -Oj &
  > pd -alsamidi ~/.cabal/share/gulcii-0.2.0.1/extra/fudi2midi.pd &
  > gulcii | pdsend 8765
  .
  See also: live-sequencer which has many more features (but no sharing during
  evaluation).
