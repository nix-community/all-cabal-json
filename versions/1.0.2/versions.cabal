description:         A library for parsing and comparing software version numbers.
                     .
                     We like to give version numbers to our software in a myriad of different
                     ways. Some ways follow strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison.
                     Some follow conventional wisdom and are generally self-consistent.
                     Some are just plain asinine. This library provides a means of parsing
                     and comparing /any/ style of versioning, be it a nice Semantic Version
                     like this:
                     .
                     > 1.2.3-r1+git123
                     .
                     ...or a monstrosity like this:
                     .
                     > 2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1
                     .
                     Please switch to <http://semver.org Semantic Versioning> if you
                     aren't currently using it. It provides consistency in version
                     incrementing and has the best constraints on comparisons.
