description:
    This library provides a single global lock.  You can use it, for example,
    to protect a thread-unsafe C library.
    .
    The implementation does not use @unsafePerformIO@.  It should be safe
    against GHC bugs such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5558>.
    .
    You can use this library as-is, or as a template for including a similar
    lock in your own Haskell project.
    .
    This library requires that the C compiler invoked by Cabal is GCC 4.1 or
    newer.
