-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            A simple web server for serving directories, similar to weborf.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         
    The main drivers for this application were Windows (and Linux) support and
    security, and to a lesser extent performance.  Security is improved over
    weborf by using Haskell, supporting TLS, and explicitly NOT supporting CGIs
    of any kind.
