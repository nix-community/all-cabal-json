Synopsis:            Upload video to YouTube via YouTube API
Description:
  Upload a video to YouTube via YouTube API.
  The aim of this program is to simplify uploads of related videos.
  .
  First you must have the @curl@ executable installed.
  .
  In order to use the @youtube-upload@ command
  you need a YouTube account and an additional developer account.
  From the developer account you get a keyfile.
  If you want to upload videos you first have to login to YouTube.
  As a result of this you get an authentication token.
  Write this authentication token into the @YOUTUBEAUTH@ environment variable.
  It is queried by @youtube-upload@.
  For every upload you have to pass the developer keyfile,
  an XML file containing meta data for the video and the video file.
  .
  The XML file must be encoded with UTF-8.
  I found it very useful to generate the XML files
  from an XML template file and a CSV table
  using the @cvsreplace@ command from the @spreadsheet@ package.
