Synopsis:       Simplified Pascal language to SSVM compiler
Category:       Languages, Compilers/Interpreters
Build-Type:     Simple
Description:    This package provides a compiler for simplified variant of Pascal language.
                That language includes conditional statements, for loops, procedures and
                functions. But it does not support complex data types (only integer, string
                and boolean are supported currently).
                This compiler outputs bytecode which may be run by SSVM (see simple-stacked-vm
                package).
