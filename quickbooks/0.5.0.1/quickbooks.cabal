description: This package is a binding to the QuickBooks API. The
             documentation can be test using the `cabal test doctests`
             command. However, the documentation tests are run against
             an Intuit sandbox which you must create.

             .

             Visit Intuit's developer site to create an "app":
             <https://developer.intuit.com/>

             .

             After creating an app you can use your "app token" and
             consumer information to aquire credentials here:
             <https://appcenter.intuit.com/Playground/OAuth>

             .

             This package is configure by environment variables. Once
             you have your credentials please export the following
             environment:
             .
             * INTUIT_COMPANY_ID (your app's company ID)
             .
             * INTUIT_CONSUMER_KEY (your app's consumer key)
             .
             * INTUIT_CONSUMER_SECRET (your app's consumer secret)
             .
             * INTUIT_TOKEN (the OAuth1.0 Token you created above *used for tests*)
             .
             * INTUIT_SECRET (the OAuth1.0 Secret you created above *used for tests*)
             .
             * INTUIT_HOSTNAME (which will be
               sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com for development/test
               environments. See the developer website for production)

             .

             You can now run verify the documentation using  `cabal test`.
