Name:                mathgenealogy

Version:             1.4.0

Synopsis:            Discover your (academic) ancestors!

Description:         A command line program for extracting data from the
  Mathematics Genealogy Project (<http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php>).
  Note that this database also contains many entries of computer scientists.
  .
  Lookup your entry at <http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php> and
  then use that URL as a command line argument.  
  For example, if Carl Gauss wanted to explore his academic ancestors, he
  would type
  .
  > mathgenealogy http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231 
  .
  which produces the directed acyclic graph
  <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22490968/genealogy_of_gauss.svg>. See 
  .
  > mathgenealogy --help
  .
  for the complete list of options. Requires the /dot/ program, which is
  part of the GraphViz package (/version 2.28.0 or later!/) to run.
  .
  Note: Due to some inconsistencies in the character encodings used on  
  mathgenealogy, you might need to correct entries that use special characters.
  .
  Feedback and bug reports are appreciated!

  /Changes in 1.4.0:/
  .
  * Updated to handle changes in page layout. 
  .
  /Changes in 1.3.0:/
  .
  * Switched to HTML-like labels in GraphViz. This is required for the advanced
    font formatting options. ATTENTION: this needs a recent
    installation of GraphViz (Linux: 2.28.0; MacOS: 2.29) and will yield
    best results for SVG output files. If you have an older version of GraphViz
    or run into issues, try the '--oldtextlabels' option.
  .
  * Downloaded entries are stored locally. This avoids re-downloading the same
    data if you want to generate multiple graphs of the same entry with
    different formatting options.
  .
  * Added more options for fine-tuning the fonts and colors. (requested by users)
  .
  * Default output is now SVG, as this is the format best supported by GraphViz.
  .
  /Changes in 1.2.0:/
  .
  * Fixed handling of entries that have multiple degrees. (reported by Dima Pasechnik)
  . 
  /Changes in 1.1.1:/
  .
  * Provide error message when given invalid start URL
  . 
  * Documentation and code cleanup
  .
  /Changes in 1.0.0:/
  .
  * Choice between PDF and PNG output
  .
  * Optional inclusion of PhD theses in output
  .
  /Changes in 0.0.2:/
  .
  * Fixed handling of trailing commas (reported by Alexander Koessler)
