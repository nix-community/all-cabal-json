Synopsis:               trhsx is the preprocessor for Harp and HSP
Description:            trhsx, the desugaring pre-processor executable for HaRP and HSP.
                        Requires haskell-src-exts to build.
                        .
                        It is meant to be used as a preprocessor for GHC, with the command
                        'ghc -F -pgmF trhsx infile'. It can also be used as a separate tool,
                        in which case the command-line syntax is:
                        .
                        $ trhsx \<infile\>   Desugars \<infile\> and gives the result on standard output.
                        .
                        $ trhsx \<infile\> \<outfile\>  Desugars \<infile\> and writes the result to \<outfile\>.
                        .
                        The pre-processed files rely on pattern guards and will therefore work with GHC only.
                        .
