Stability:  experimental
Build-type:	Simple
Description: Set of simple tools for standardized development of UI where
             input is set of fields of certain (though various) types
             and there is defined business logic between the fields, values
             they can accept. Helps with error messages for user.
             It's idea is separation of presentation layer and business logic.
             This succeed but at certain costs.
             Tool is definetely experimental. Contains lots of awkward hacks.
