Synopsis:     Replaces some Prelude functions for enhanced error reporting
Description:  Interlude is a CPP include file, and a module which you can use instead of the
              (often implicit) Prelude import.  It replaces some partial
              functions (i.e. functions that may fail on correctly typed input like 'head []')
              with pattern matches, so that a sensible error message that includes
              location can be printed out.
