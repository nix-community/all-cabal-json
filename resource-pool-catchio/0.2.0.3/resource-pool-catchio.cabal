name:                resource-pool-catchio
version:             0.2.0.3
synopsis:            Fork of resource-pool, with a MonadCatchIO constraint
description:
  This is a fork of Bryan O'Sullivan's resource-pool package. The only
  difference is that it relies on MonadCatchIO, rather than MonadControlIO. If
  you do not strictly need the MonadCatchIO support, please use Bryan's
  original package instead.
  A high-performance striped pooling abstraction for managing
  flexibly-sized collections of resources such as database
  connections.
