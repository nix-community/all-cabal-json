Synopsis:            A command line tool for keeping track of tasks you worked on
Description:         'task' is a simple command line tool for keeping track of 
                     tasks you are working on. Tasks are kept in a simple
                     persistent store. Each task can be tagged with arbitrary
                     key/value pairs and the results can be exported to CSV files
                     filtered on said key/value pairs.
