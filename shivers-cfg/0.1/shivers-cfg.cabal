Synopsis:            Implementation of Shivers' Control-Flow Analysis
Description:
        In his 1991 dissertation, Olin Shivers introduces a concept
        of control flow graphs for functional languages, provides an algorithm
        to statically derive a safe approximation of the control flow graph and
        proves this algorithm correct. In our student research project,
        Shivers' algorithms and proofs are formalized using the theorem prover
        system Isabelle.
        . 
        This package contains the Haskell prototype of the Isabelle
        formalization, together with some pretty printing and rendering
        facilities. It is provided as a reference, not as a ready-to-use library.
