synopsis:		Simple, VNC based graphics rendering system
description: Chitra in most Indian languages means "Image". This aim of this project is to build an VNC library that can be used to develop interactive graphical application. What I think will be the strength of Chitra would be its "platform independence". So, the idea is, the library would have a "putpixel" function which when called would render a pixel on an image buffer that would be rendered via the vnc server. For viewing and interactive with the aplication, one would use a standard VNC client. Eventually, I might chose to do this using the RDP protocol that even has support for sound.  

	To try out -

	Just do a make and you should have the executable *Main* created. 

	Run ./Main <width> <height> <port> 

	Now try connecting a vnc client to localhost:5900
