synopsis: Extensible double-entry accounting system

description: Penny is a double-entry accounting system. It is inspired
  by, but incompatible with, John Wiegley's Ledger, which is available
  at <http://ledger-cli.org/>. Installing this package with cabal
  install will install the executable program and the necessary
  libraries.

  .

  * Penny is a double-entry accounting system. It uses traditional
  accounting terminology, such as the terms \"Debit\" and
  \"Credit\". If you need a refresher on the basics of double-entry
  accounting, pick up a used accounting textbook from your favorite
  bookseller (they can be had cheaply, for less than ten U.S. dollars
  including shipping) or check out
  <http://www.principlesofaccounting.com/>, a great free online text.

  .

  * Penny is based around "Penny.Lincoln", a core library to represent
    transactions and postings and their components, such as their
    amounts and whether they are debits and credits. You can use
    Lincoln all by itself even if you don't use the other components
    of Penny, which you may find handy if you are a Haskell
    programmer. I wrote Penny because I wanted a precise library to
    represent my accounting data so I could analyze it programatically
    and verify its consistency.

  .

  * Penny's command line interface and its reports give you
    great flexibility to filter and sort postings. Each posting
    within a transaction may have its own flags assigned (e.g. to
    indicate whether the posting is cleared) and each posting may have
    infinite \"tags\" assigned to it, giving you another way to
    categorize your postings. For instance, you might have vacation
    related postings in several different accounts, but you can give
    them all a \"vacation\" tag.

  .

  * You can easily build a program to process downloads of Open
    Financial Exchange data from your financial institution. Your
    program will merge new transactions into your ledger
    automatically.

  .

  * Full Unicode support.

  .

  * Penny's reports have color baked in from the beginning. You do not
    have to use color, which is handy if you are sending
    output to a file or if, well, you just don't like color.

  .

  * Penny's reports automatically adjust themselves to the width of
    your screen. You can easily specify how much or how little data to
    see with command line options.

  .

  * Penny handles multiple commodities (for example, multiple
    currencies, stocks and bonds, tracking other assets, etc.) in an
    easy and transparent way that is consistent with double-entry
    accounting principles. It embraces the philosophy outlined in this
    tutorial on multiple commodity accounting:
    <http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html>.

  .

  * Penny stores amounts using only integers.  This ensures the
    accuracy of your data, as using floating point values to represent
    money is a bad idea. Here is one explanation:
    <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730019/why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency>. The
    use of integer arithmetic also makes Penny simpler internally, as
    there is no need for arbitrary rounding to compensate for the
    bizarre and inaccurate results that sometimes arise from the use of
    floating-point values to represent currencies.

  .

  * Freely licensed under the MIT license. If you take this code,
    improve it, lock it up and make it proprietary, and sell it,
    AWESOME! I haven't lost anything because I still have my code and,
    what's more, then maybe I can buy your product and not have to
    maintain this one any more!

  .

  * Tested using QuickCheck. The tests are available in the Git
    repository that also contains the main library. Not everything
    is tested, but the tests that exist so far have already rooted
    out some strange corner-case bugs.

  .

  Non-features / disadvantages:

  .

  * Written in Haskell. Yes, I think Haskell is the best tool ever,
    but its compiler is not as commonly installed as compilers for C
    or C++, and non-Haskellers will probably find Penny to be more
    difficult to install than Ledger, as the latter is written in C++.

  .

  * Handling commodities requires that you set up multiple accounts;
    some might find this cumbersome.

  .

  * Young and not well tested yet.

  .

  * Runs only on Unix-like operating systems.

  .

  * Full Penny functionality is available without a Haskell compiler;
    you could even use a pre-compiled binary.  However, Penny does not
    read configuration files at runtime; instead, to change the
    default settings, you will need to have GHC installed so that you
    can compile a custom binary.

  .

  * Can be slow and memory hungry with large data sets. I have a
    ledger file with about 28,000 lines. On my least capable machine
    (which has an Intel Core 2 Duo at 1.6 GHz) this takes about 1.4
    seconds to parse. Not horrible but not instantaneous
    either. Generating a report about all these transactions can take
    about seven seconds and a little less than 300 MB of memory. I
    have eliminated all the obvious slowness from the code and
    attempted a rewrite of the parser, which made no difference; other
    ideas to speed up Penny with large data sets would involve
    substantial changes and this is not at the top of my list because
    the program is currently usable with relatively recent hardware.

  .

  Unfortunately running \"cabal install\" will not
  install the documentation, so you will need to find the downloaded
  archive (usually in
  \"$HOME/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/penny\") and unpack it
  to see the documentation. You will want to start by reading the
  README file, which will point you to additional documentation and
  how to install it if you wish.
