synopsis:            simplified import of essential lens combinators

description:         This module, @Lens.Simple@, just re-exports the main modules from Russell O\'Connor's 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core> 
                     package, the original <http://r6.ca/blog/20120623T104901Z.html van Laarhoven lens> library. 
                     @Lens.Simple@ also re-exports @makeLenses@ and 
                     other TH incantations from Dan Burton's associated 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-th lens-family-th>. 
                     .
                     The idea is just to make a lens-family equivalent of @import Control.Lens@, namely @import Lens.Simple@ 
                     /-/- it's even one character shorter! As an illustration, note that 
                     the <https://github.com/michaelt/lens-family-simple/blob/master/examples/Pong.hs pong example> 
                     from the @lens@ library requires only this abbreviating change of imports. 
                     .
                     Similarly, when need arises for the unfathomably more 
                     sophisticated material in @Control.Lens@, a
                     change of imports will tend be all that is necessary 
                     to begin using them. 
                     .
                     It should be kept in mind that the @zoom@ exported here does
                     not use @MonadState@ from @mtl@ but is 
                     specialized to @Control.Monad.Trans.State.Strict@  Many of
                     the other lenses and combinators are a bit more 
                     specialized than their @Control.Lens@ equivalents: 
                     for example, _1 and _2 are here 
                     familiarly specialized to act just on real Haskell
                     pairs; with the loss of abstraction we also of course
                     lose the concomitant opaque error messages 
                     about @Field1 s t a b@ etc.
