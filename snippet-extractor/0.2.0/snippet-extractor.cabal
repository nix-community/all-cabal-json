Name:                snippet-extractor
Version:             0.2.0
Synopsis:            Extracts labeled snippets of code to files.
Description:         Snippet-extractor looks for snippets in files and
                     places those snippets in their own files.
                     .
                     A snippet is defined as consecutive lines in a
                     file delimited by \"\@snippet-start \<filename\>\" and
                     \"\@snippet-end\", the extracted snippet is placed in
                     the provided filename.  If the desired filename
                     contains spaces, put the filename in quotes.
                     .
                     Everything on the line with the start and end
                     markers is discarded.  Snippet-extractor should
                     be agnostic to the syntax of the file you are
                     extracting from.
                     .
                     Here is an example:
                     .
                     >  /* @snippet-start snippet1.c */
                     >  for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
                     >    printf("%d\n",i);
                     >  }
                     >  /* @snippet-end */
                     .
                     The above snippet would be extracted and placed in
                     snippet1.c
                     .
                     Snippet-extractor is intended for use in
                     documentation.  For example, the snippets could
                     be extracted from working code and then included
                     in a text about the code.
