version:             0.1
synopsis:            Minimal implementation(s) of the classic electronic memory game.
description:         This was an attempt to submit a ludum dare entry in 2h.
                     It is also a nice kata (exercise) for practising haskell game development
                     and/or demonstrating different libraries and approaches.
                     Improvements, new implementations and co-developers are welcome.
                     .
                     Currently there is one implementation, a minimal ansi command line one.
                     See README for more.
