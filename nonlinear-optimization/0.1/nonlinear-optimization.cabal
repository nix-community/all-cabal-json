Synopsis:            Various iterative algorithms for optimization of nonlinear functions.
Description:
    This library implements numerical algorithms to optimize
    nonlinear functions.  Optimization means that we try to find
    a minimum of the function.  Currently all algorithms
    guarantee only that local minima will be found, not global
    ones.
    .
    Almost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -> R@
    may be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions
    are listed in the modules that need them.
    .
    We use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and
    matrices, although it would be possible to use something like
    @hmatrix@ easily.
    .
    Currently only CM_DESCENT method is implemented.
