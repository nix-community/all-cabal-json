Name:                disjoint-set
Version:             0.2
Synopsis:            Persistent disjoint-sets, a.k.a union-find.
Description:         This is a persistent data structure for disjoint sets.
                     .
                     The algorithm is described in "Introduction to
                     Algorithms" by Cormen, et al. The implementation here
                     uses both union by rank and path compression. We
                     incur an O(logn) overhead because of the use of
                     persistent maps.
                     .
                     Data.IntDisjointSet is as strict as possible.
