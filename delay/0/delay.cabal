description:
  Functions to provide delays, timeouts, and callbacks where the target time is calculated either from a period as an offset from the initialization time, or at a specific 'UTCTime'.
  .
  Most standard Haskell types are supported for periods, based on the second as the base unit quantity. For more complicated period calculations, 'Dimensional's 'Time' type is supported.
