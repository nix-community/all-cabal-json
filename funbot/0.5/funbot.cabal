name:                funbot
version:             0.5
synopsis:            IRC bot for fun, learning, creativity and collaboration.
description:
  One day an idea came up on the #freepost IRC channel: We didn't need much of
  the serious features IRC bots provide, but we could develop an IRC bot
  collaboratively, for fun and for learning new skills and languages! I also
  thought this is a great chance for people to quickly see their code in real
  use, which is motivating when learning programming, and it's a chance to
  introduce Haskell to the community.
  .
  While the bot is made for and by the <https://freepo.st Freepost> community,
  it is fully intended for use any anyone else! For experienced Haskell
  developers, this bot can perhaps provide space for creativity and custom
  advanced plugins and features.
  .
  Since this bot is meant for collaborative development while really running
  it, the running instance in @#freepost@ is built from the git repository.
  Occasionally releases will be made to Hackage. If you want to be sure you
  have all the latest features, check out the git repository (and/or ask us to
  make a release if you think it's been long enough).
