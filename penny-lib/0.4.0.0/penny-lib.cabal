synopsis: Extensible double-entry accounting system - library

description: Penny is a double-entry accounting system. It is inspired
  by, but incompatible with, John Wiegley's Ledger, which is available
  at <http://ledger-cli.org/>. You will want to install the package
  penny-bin by using cabal install penny-bin, which will install the
  executable program and this library as well. Features:

  .

  * Penny is a double-entry accounting system. It uses traditional
  accounting terminology, such as the terms \"Debit\" and
  \"Credit\". If you need a refresher on the basics of double-entry
  accounting, pick up a used accounting textbook from your favorite
  bookseller (they can be had cheaply, for less than ten U.S. dollars
  including shipping) or check out
  <http://www.principlesofaccounting.com/>, a great free online text.

  .

  * Penny is based around "Penny.Lincoln", a core library to represent
    transactions and postings and their components, such as their
    amounts and whether they are debits and credits. You can use
    Lincoln all by itself even if you don't use the other components
    of Penny, which you may find handy if you are a Haskell
    programmer. I wrote Penny because I wanted a precise library to
    represent my accounting data so I could analyze it programatically
    and verify its consistency. I wrote it in Haskell not because I
    wanted to write something in Haskell but because Haskell is the
    best tool for this job (I used to use the shell, combined with
    Ledger, which is a messy combination.)

  .

  * Penny's command line interface, Zinc, and its reports, Cabin, give
    you unparalleled flexibility to filter and sort postings. Each
    posting within a transaction may have its own flags assigned
    (e.g. to indicate whether the posting is cleared) and each posting
    may have infinite \"tags\" assigned to it, giving you another way
    to categorize your postings. For instance, you might have vacation
    related postings in several different accounts, but you can give
    them all a \"vacation\" tag.

  .

  * Full Unicode support. Also, you may set which characters you wish
    to use to represent the radix point and the digit grouping
    character in your ledger file.

  .

  * Penny's reports, in "Penny.Cabin", have color baked in from the
    beginning. You do not have to use color, though, which is handy if
    you are sending output to a file or if, well, you just don't like
    color.

  .

  * Penny's reports are customizable in Haskell, giving you an easy
    and powerful way to make your own reports without writing cryptic
    formatting strings.

  .

  * Penny handles multiple commodities (for example, multiple
    currencies, stocks and bonds, tracking other assets, etc.) in an
    easy and transparent way that is consistent with double-entry
    accounting principles. It embraces the philosophy outlined in this
    tutorial on multiple commodity accounting:
    <http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html>.

  .

  * Penny stores amounts using only integers, building from the
    Data.Decimal library available at
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Decimal>. This ensures the
    accuracy of your data, as using floating point values to represent
    money is a bad idea. Here is one explanation:
    <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730019/why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency>. The
    use of integer arithmetic also makes Penny simpler internally, as
    there is no need for arbitrary rounding to compensate for the
    bizarre and inaccurate results that sometimes arise from the use of
    floating-point values to represent currencies.

  .

  * Freely licensed under the MIT license. If you take this code,
    improve it, lock it up and make it proprietary, and sell it,
    AWESOME! I haven't lost anything because I still have my code and,
    what's more, then maybe I can buy your product and not have to
    maintain this one any more!

  .

  * Uses no GHC extensions. However, the code is only tested under GHC
    and for all practical purposes it will only run under GHC at this
    time because it uses libraries such as Data.Text that are
    available only under GHC. Despite this I expect I will continue to
    avoid language extensions.

  .

  Non-features / disadvantages:

  .

  * Written in Haskell. Yes, I think Haskell is the best tool ever,
    but its compiler is not as commonly installed as compilers for C
    or C++, and non-Haskellers will probably find Penny to be more
    difficult to install than Ledger, as the latter is written in C++.

  .

  * Handling commodities requires that you set up multiple accounts;
    some might find this cumbersome.

  .

  * Young and not well tested yet. Also, only tested on Unix. It
    probably would not be difficult to make Penny run on Windows; if
    someone wants to do that, go ahead.

  .

  * Full Penny functionality is available without a Haskell compiler;
    you could even use a pre-compiled binary. However, to fully
    customize Penny, you will need a Haskell compiler installed.

  .

  * Can be slow and memory hungry with large data sets. I have a
    ledger file with about 28,000 lines. On my least capable machine
    (which has an Intel Core 2 Duo at 1.6 GHz) this takes about 1.4
    seconds to parse. Not horrible but not instantaneous
    either. Generating a report about all these transactions can take
    about seven seconds and a little less than 300 MB of memory. I
    have eliminated all the obvious slowness from the code and
    attempted a rewrite of the parser, which made no difference; other
    ideas to speed up Penny with large data sets would involve
    substantial changes and this is not at the top of my list because
    the program is currently usable with relatively recent hardware.

  .

  More details about the organization of the Penny modules is
  available by examining the top "Penny" module.

  .

  This is only a library. For the executable package, which also
  includes more documentation, search for the penny-bin package on
  Hackage.
