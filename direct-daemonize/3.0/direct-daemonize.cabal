synopsis: Library to switch to daemon mode using built-in OS facilities.
description:
  This package is a wrapper around the daemon() function on BSD-like Unices,
  including Mac OS X and glibc-based Linux distributions.  It does not function
  on other systems.
  
  Version 3.0 cleans up the parameters structure.
  
  Version 2.0 fixes compatibility problems with the threaded GHC runtime.
  Doing this required two non-backwards-compatible API changes.  First, the daemonize function now takes an action to perform as a daemon, and never
  returns.  Second, the functionality of closing all open files has been
  removed, as it caused crashes.  As a substitute, the option of closing only
  the three standard streams has been added and made the default.
