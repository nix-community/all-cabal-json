synopsis: Library to switch to daemon mode using built-in OS facilities.
description:
  This package is a wrapper around the daemon() function on BSD-like Unices,
  including Mac OS X and glibc-based Linux distributions.  It does not function
  on other systems.
  .
  Version 3.1 adds the ability to do something after forking but before
  dropping privileges.  It also no longer uses the system-provided daemon()
  function, which is highly unfortunate but necessary with the RTS's use of
  per-process timers.
  .
  Version 3.0.0.1 updates this documentation to be properly broken into
  paragraphs.
  .
  Version 3.0 cleans up the parameters structure.
  .
  Version 2.0 fixes compatibility problems with the threaded GHC runtime.
  Doing this required two non-backwards-compatible API changes.  First, the
  daemonize function now takes an action to perform as a daemon, and never
  returns.  Second, the functionality of closing all open files has been
  removed, as it caused crashes.  As a substitute, the option of closing only
  the three standard streams has been added and made the default.
  .
  Version 1.0 was the initial release.
