synopsis:            an elementary streaming prelude and a general monad transformer for streaming applications.

description:         @Streaming.Prelude@ exports an elementary streaming prelude; @Streaming@ exports a free monad transformer 
                     optimized for streaming applications and replacing @FreeT@. See the 
                     <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below
                     for an explanation. Elementary usage can be divined from the ghci examples in 
                     @Streaming.Prelude@
                     .
                     The simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>
                     is accomplished with this isomorphism:
                     .
                     > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r
                     > Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m r                     
                     .
                     Interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams> is thus:
                     .
                     > Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO ()
                     > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)
                     .
                     A simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be, e.g.:
                     .
                     > Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a
                     .
                     These conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=$=@. Further
                     points of comparison are discussed in the 
                     <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme>
                     below.
                     .
