synopsis:            A free monad transformer optimized for streaming applications.
                     
description:         `Stream` can be used wherever `FreeT` is used. The compiler's
                     standard range of optimizations work better for operations 
                     written in terms of `Stream`. @FreeT f m r@ / @Stream f m r@
                     is of course extremely general, and many functor-general combinators
                     are exported by the general module @Streaming@. 
                     . 
                     See the examples in @Streaming.Prelude@ for a sense of how 
                     simple the library is to use and think about. 
                     That module is focused on employment with such base functors 
                     (readings of the @f@ in @Stream f m r@) that express 
                     different forms of effectful sequences. Some of these appear 
                     elsewhere under titles like
                     .
                     > pipes:      Producer a m r, Producer a m (Producer a m r), FreeT (Producer a m) m r
                     > io-streams: InputStream a, Generator a r
                     > conduit:    Source m a, ConduitM () o m r
                     .
                     and the like. @Streaming.Prelude@ closely follows 
                     @Pipes.Prelude@, but cleverly /omits the pipes/. 
                     .
                     Interoperation with 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>
                     is accomplished with this isomorphism:
                     .  
                     > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r
                     > Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m r                     
                     .
                     Interoperation with 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams> 
                     is thus:
                     .
                     > Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO ()
                     > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)
                     .
                     A simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be, e.g.:
                     .
                     > Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a
                     .
                     These conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=$=@.
                     .
                     With a much more general level, we also of course have interopetion with 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free free>:
                     .
                     Free.iterTM  Stream.wrap              :: FreeT f m a -> Stream f m a
                     Stream.iterTM Free.wrap               :: Stream f m a -> FreeT f m a 
                     .
