synopsis:
  Low level bindings supporting GTS, the GNU Triangulated Surface Library
description:
  This package contains bindings to GTS library using
  bindings-DSL macros and style. Like GObject, it's
  not useful by itself, but as a foundation for other
  libraries making use of its type system. NOTE: these bindings
  were not made by the author(s) of GTS so please don't bug them
  about issues with the bindings! Any errors in these bindings 
  are my responsibility not that of the GTS team. Not all functionality
  is covered by these bindings at this time, but there should be enough
  to be useful.
