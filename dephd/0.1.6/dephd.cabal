Synopsis:       Analyze quality of nucleotide sequences.
Description:    dephd - A simple tool for base calling and quality appraisal.
                .
                Reads files in phd-format (phred output), either specified individually,
                or in a directory (use the --input-dirs option to read directories 
		or --input-list to read from an index file).  Can also read FASTA with an 
		associated quality file.
		.
		Can trim according to Lucy or Phred parameters, can mask by quality, can plot
		graphs (via gnuplot) of sequence quality to a window, or to JPG/EPS files.  Can
		categorize sequences according to overall quality.  Also constructs files suitable for
		submission to dbEST.  More information at <http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2010/09/07/submitting-ests-upstream/>.
		.
		Also provides 'fakequal', a utility to generate bogus quality values,
		which are sometimes needed by less flexible tools.
