Synopsis:       Interface to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3)
Description:    This is the Haskell S3 library.  It provides an
                interface to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), allowing Haskell
                developers to reliably store and retrieve arbitrary amounts of
                data from anywhere on the Internet.
