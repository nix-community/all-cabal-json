Synopsis:		Esotericbot is a sophisticated, lightweight IRC bot.
Description:		
			Esotericbot is a sophisticated, lightweight IRC bot, written in Haskell.
			.
			Esotericbot launches sub-processes to respond to commands issued by users over IRC.
			.
			Why would you use esotericbot?
			.
			For lambdabot-4.2.2.1:
			.
			spoon@utensil:~/esotericbot$ ps e v
			.
			  PID TTY      STAT   TIME  MAJFL   TRS   DRS   RSS %MEM COMMAND
			.
			23433 pts/3    Sl+    0:00      0  8228 84855 33476  1.6 lambdabot
			.
			15040 pts/5    S+     0:00      0  2171 28804  3292  0.1 ./esotericbot
                        .
                        I'm not insinuating that lambdabot sucks in any way, ( it has cool stateful features, and is stable and excellent ) however, my hope is that esotericbot could attain equal functionality through plugins, while maintaining its small memory footprint.
                        .
			Esotericbot is small ( for Haskell :), designed to run on a server with limited memory - typically running at under 5mb of private memory.
			.
			Features:
			.
			* Advanced memory and time management options, utilizing POSIX resource management.
			.
			For example, the memory used by all child processes, can be limited - commands be queued until the memory usage has dropped.
			.
			* Privileged channel operator commands ( Currently, can be disabled and enabled by channel operators, to prevent abuse. )
			.
			* Easy to add new plugins.  A C library is included to make writing new plugins/adapting programs to be plugins easy.
			.
			* Set up through a configuration file.
			.
			* Multiple channels.
			.
			* Multi-threaded
			.
			* Lightweight, typically running at under 5mb of private memory.
			.
			Cons:
			.
			* POSIX memory management, process forking, and chroot means that Esotericbot is POSIX only.
			.
			* Esotericbot is, due to the libraries and extensions used, restricted to being compiled by the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
			.
			.
			Note: esotericbot comes with several plugins which will be installed into your cabal-bin, and libraries installed into your cabal-lib.  Check cabal-bin for 'brainfuck', 'unlambda' , 'malbolge', 'sk' and 'whirl'.  These will need libplugin and libplugin++ from your cabal-lib to function correctly.
