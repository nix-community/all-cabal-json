synopsis:       Convert adblock config files to privoxy format
description:    
                       AdBlock Plus browser plugin has great block list files provided by big community,
                       but it is client software and cannot work on a server as proxy.
                       .
                       Privoxy proxy has good potential to block ads at server side,
                       but it experiences acute shortage of updated block lists.
                       .
                       This software converts adblock lists to privoxy config files format.
                       .
                       Almost all adblock features are supported including
                       .
                       * block/unblock requests (on privoxy)
                       .
                       all syntax features are supported except for regex templates matching host name
                       .
                       * hide/unhide page elements (via CSS)
                       .
                       all syntax features are supported
                       .
                       * all block request options except for outdated ones:
                       .
                       Supported: script, image, stylesheet, object, xmlhttprequest, object-subrequest, subdocument,
                       document, elemhide, other, popup, third-party, domain=..., match-case, donottrack
                       .
                       Unsupported: collapse, background, xbl, ping and dtd
