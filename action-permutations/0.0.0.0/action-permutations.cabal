synopsis:     Execute a set of actions (e.g. parsers) in each possible order
description:
    Sequence a set of Alternative actions in each possible order,
    based on \"Parsing Permutation Phrases\", by Arthur Baars,
    Andres Loeh and S. Doaitse Swierstra, /Haskell Workshop 2001/.
    This is particularly useful for constructing a parser for
    permutations of elements.
    This version has a slightly different interface from the paper.
