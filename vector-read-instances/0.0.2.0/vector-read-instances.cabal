description:
                Read instances for 'Data.Vector'. Right now, only for unboxed
                vectors. Others should be easy to implement, though.
                .
                It is planned to have read instances included in the vector
                library in the future. This release is only temporary.
                .
                vector >= 0.8 has Read instances for all immutable vectors.
