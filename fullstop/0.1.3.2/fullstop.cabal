name:                fullstop
version:             0.1.3.2
synopsis:            Simple sentence segmenter
description:         FullStop splits texts into sentences, using some orthographical
                     conventions (used in English and hopefully other languages).
                     .
                     It recognises certain punctuation characters as sentence
                     delimiters (@.?!@) and handles some abbreviations such as
                     @Mr.@ and decimal numbers (eg. @4.2@).
                     .
                     Note that this package is mostly a placeholder.  I hope
                     the Haskell/NLP communities will run with it and upload
                     a more sophisticated (family of) segmenter(s) in its
                     place.  Patches (and new maintainers) would be greeted
                     with delight!
