version:       0.0.12
synopsis:      A DSL to describe common shell operations and interpeters for running them locally and remotely.
description:
    @handsy@ is a small library mainly for applications which should make some
    operations on remote machines by SSH. It currently provides you:
    .
    * A DSL describing basic system operations('command', 'readFile', 'writeFile' etc.)
    .
    * Two interpreters for running this DSL locally or via SSH('run' and 'runRemote')
    .
    * Some utility functions for common commands('os', 'mkTemp' etc.)
    .
    If you're looking for a shell scripting alternative, look at @turtle@, @shelly@ or
    @shellmate@ packages. @handsy@ is mostly relevant for the ability to apply simple
    commands remotely.
