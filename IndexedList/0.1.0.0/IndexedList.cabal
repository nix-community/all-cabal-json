name:                IndexedList
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Length-indexed and element-indexed lists which sit somewhere between homogeneous and fully heterogeneous lists.
description:         This library implements /counted lists/ linked to type-level naturals indexing length, compatible with the Peano natural numbers found in "Data.Numeric.Witness.Peano", as well as so-called /conic lists/, which are linked to a type index listing the type indices of partially-heterogeneous values contained within.
