description:
        This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
        sendmail-compatible script.
        .
        The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
        send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
        to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)
        .
        smtp2mta can be run as a standalone server, or can serve connections
        from behind inetd.
