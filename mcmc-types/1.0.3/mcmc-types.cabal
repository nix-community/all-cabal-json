description:
  Common types for implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
  .
  An instance of an MCMC problem can be characterized by the following:
  .
  * A /target distribution/ over some parameter space
  .
  * A /parameter space/ for a Markov chain to wander over
  .
  * A /transition operator/ to drive the Markov chain
  .
  /mcmc-types/ provides the suitably-general 'Target', 'Chain', and
  'Transition' types for representing these things respectively.
