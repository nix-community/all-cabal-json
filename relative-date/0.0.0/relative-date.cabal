synopsis:            Durations and generalized time parsing
description:         Relative-date provides two modules.  Data.Duration gives
					 functions for the creation of durations of time, represented
					 as functions from DateTime to DateTime.  Data.DateTime.Parser
					 presents miscellaneous parsers for handling time descriptions
					 of varying levels of detail.  The library also can parse
					 descriptions of repeated times, returning a (possibly infinite)
					 list of DateTimes.
