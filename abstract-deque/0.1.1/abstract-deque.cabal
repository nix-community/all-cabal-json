Synopsis: Abstract, parameterized interface to mutable Deques.

Description:

  An abstract interface to highly-parameterizable queues/deques.
  . 
  Background: There exists a feature space for queues that extends between:
  .
    * simple, single-ended, non-concurrent, bounded queues 
  .
    * double-ended, threadsafe, growable queues
  .
  ... with important points inbetween (such as
  the queues used for work-stealing).
  .
  This package includes an interface for Deques that allows the
  programmer to use a single API for all of the above, while using the
  type-system to select an efficient implementation given the
  requirements (using type families).
  .
  This package also includes a simple reference implementation based
  on 'IORef' and 'Data.Sequence'.
