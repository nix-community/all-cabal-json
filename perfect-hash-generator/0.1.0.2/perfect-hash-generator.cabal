synopsis:       Perfect minimal hashing implementation in native Haskell
description:     A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function perfect hash function> for a set @S@ is a hash function that maps distinct elements in @S@ to a set of integers, with __no collisions__. A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function#Minimal_perfect_hash_function minimal perfect hash function> is a perfect hash function that maps @n@ keys to @n@ __consecutive__ integers, e.g. the numbers from @0@ to @n-1@.
                .
                In contrast with the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/PerfectHash PerfectHash package>, which is a binding to a C-based library, this package is a fully-native Haskell implementation.
                .
                It is intended primarily for generating C code for embedded applications (compare to @<https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html#Search-Structures gperf>@). The output of this tool is a pair of arrays that can be included in generated C code for __<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation allocation>-free hash tables__.
                .
                Though lookups also perform reasonably well for Haskell applications, it hasn't been benchmarked thorougly with respect to other data structures.
                .
                This implementation was adapted from <http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=119 Steve Hanov's Blog>.
                .
                = Usage
                The library is written generically to hash both strings and raw integers. Integers should be wrapped in the @Atom@ newtype:
                .
                > import Data.PerfectHash.Construction (createMinimalPerfectHash)
                >
                > tuples = [
                >    (Atom 1000, 1)
                >  , (Atom 5555, 2)
                >  , (Atom 9876, 3)
                >  ]
                >
                > lookup_table = createMinimalPerfectHash tuples
                .
                Generation of C code based on the arrays in @lookup_table@ is left as an exercise to the reader. Algorithm documentation in the "Data.PerfectHash.Hashing" and "Data.PerfectHash.Lookup" modules will be helpful.
                .
                See the @hash-perfectly-strings-demo@ and @hash-perfectly-ints-demo@, as well as the test suite, for working examples.
                .
                > $ stack build
                > $ stack exec hash-perfectly-strings-demo
                .
                = Caveats
                Only integer keys of at most __32-bits__ have been demonstrated to work properly.  Since the hash function masks to 32 bits, colliding 64-bit integers can hang the lookup table construction.
