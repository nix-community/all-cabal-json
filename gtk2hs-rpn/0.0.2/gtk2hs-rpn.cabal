version: 0.0.2
synopsis:
  Adds a module to gtk2hs allowing layouts to
  be defined using reverse polish notation.
description:
  Adds a module 'Graphics.UI.Gtk.Layout.Rpn' to gtk2hs. This
  module defines a type 'RPN' for operators, and is an instance
  of Monoid class.  You can combine those operators using reverse
  polish notation, as made popular by, say, HP calculators. There
  are operators for layout elements, like expanders, panes,
  boxes and notebooks, and for a few other widgets, like buttons
  and labels. You can include any gtk2hs widget in the stack.
