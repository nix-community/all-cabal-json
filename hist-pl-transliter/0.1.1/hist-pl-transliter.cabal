name:               hist-pl-transliter
version:            0.1.1
synopsis:           A simple EDSL for transliteration rules
description:
    The library provides a simple embedded domain specific language for
    defining transliteration rules.
    Additionally, the library includes a set of rules prepared (within the SYNAT
    project) for documents collected throughout the IMPACT project (available
    at <http://dl.psnc.pl/activities/projekty/impact/results/>).
    .
    A transliteration system, developed independently within the IMPACT
    project, may be also of interest.
    It can be found at <https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/pol>.
