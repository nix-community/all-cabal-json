synopsis:            Access the local computer's basic network configuration
description:         This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
                     networking configuration. It is currently capable of getting a list of
                     all the network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
                     addresses.
                     .
                     The executable 'test-network-info' will only be built if the flag 'test'
                     has been set.
