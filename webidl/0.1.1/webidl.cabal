Synopsis:       Parser and Pretty Printer for the Web IDL Language
Description:    Web IDL is a dialect of OMG IDL used by the Web App group to specify
                component interfaces of Web applications. See also:
                .
                <http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/> - working draft of the specification
                .
                <http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/Main_Page> - Web App group wiki
                .
                <http://code.google.com/p/es-operating-system/> - an experimental
                Google - Nintendo project from which the lexer/parser files for Web IDL
                are borrowed.
                .
                The package provides a Web IDL parsing\/pretty-printing library, and
                the two executable programs:
                .
                * @idltestlex@: a debugging program which reads a Web IDL source
                from its standard input, and prints the list of tokens in raw format,
                as returned from the lexer.
                .
                * @idlppr@: a debugging program which reads a Web IDL source
                from its standard input, parses, and pretty-prints it on its
                standard output. Non-JavaDoc comments, and preprocessor directives
                that the input might contain will not appear in the output. 
                The program may be used to test the parser and pretty printer 
                in the way that when @idlppr@ reads a pretty-printed Web IDL source, 
                the output should be identical to the input. 
                .
                Changes from 1.1: the parser has been fixed to recognize outermost-declared
                scoped names (those starting with "::"), and allow for use of @DOMString@
                in typedefs and valuetypes, as the Web IDL working draft prescribes.
