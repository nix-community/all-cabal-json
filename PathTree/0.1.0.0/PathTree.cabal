synopsis: A tree used to merge and fold paths
description:
    This package contains two modules: "Data.LCRSTree" and "Data.PathTree".
    .
    A 'PathTree' is a tree used to build unified paths from some node. This
    means being able to merge multiple paths, that may overlap at the root, in
    a sensible way. The module comes with a set of functions to add paths.
    .
    A Left-Children-Right-Siblings tree ('LCRSTree') is a tree that represents
    a multi-way tree (aka, a Rose Tree) in a binary-tree format. It is the
    underlying implementation of 'PathTree'.
    .
