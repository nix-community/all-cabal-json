name:                hashids
version:             1.0.2.2
synopsis:            Hashids generates short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers.
description:         This is a Haskell port of the Hashids library. It is typically used to encode numbers to a format suitable for appearance in visible places like urls. It converts numbers like 347 into strings like yr8, or a list of numbers like [27, 986] into 3kTMd. You can also decode those ids back. This is useful in bundling several parameters into one.
