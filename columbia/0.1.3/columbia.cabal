name:                columbia
version:             0.1.3
synopsis:            Enhanced serialization for media that support seeking.
description:         Libraries such as binary and cereal support sequential reading and writing but do not rely on any further operations. Many media support seeking in files as well. This library implements a file format that supports random access to data entities by seeking. It is an attempt to improve and extend the applicability of the object graph serialization concept.
	.
	This library enforces a strong concept of immutability in its interface; this has a number of benefits including sharing of substructure. Files in its format have a nominal mutable state that changes over discrete time steps, permitting strong reasoning. See Theory module for a basic equational theory. This work was inspired by Haskell's focus on immutability, and by the programming langauge Clojure's disciplined management of mutable state.
	.
	The database's store has been implemented over memory maps for speed, and is portable between Windows and Linux platforms. This library also uses the syb-with-class library to streamline implementation of serializers for various data entities, so that you don't have to write much boilerplate ;).
	.
	Release notes for version 0.1.1:
	.
	* Changed the invariant surrounding how files are seeked for reading/writing procedures. This permits an additional optimization. See Utils module for details.
	.
	* Generalized the interface to Utils locking strategies to arbitrary monads incorporating exceptions and I/O.
	.
	Release notes for version 0.1.2:
	.
	* Minor bug fixes.
	.
	Release notes for version 0.1.3:
	.
	* implemented additional functions specifically for handling dictionaries ('Map's).
	.
	* Added basic theory.
