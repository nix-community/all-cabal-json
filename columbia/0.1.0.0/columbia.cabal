name:                columbia
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Enhanced serialization for media that support seeking.
description:         Libraries such as binary and cereal support sequential reading and writing but do not rely on any further operations. Many media support seeking in files as well. This library implements a file format that supports random access to data entities by seeking.
	.
	This library also uses the syb-with-class library to streamline implementation of serializers for various data entities, so that you don't have to write much boilerplate ;).
