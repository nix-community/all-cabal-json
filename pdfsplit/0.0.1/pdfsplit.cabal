Name:                pdfsplit
Version:             0.0.1
Synopsis:            split two-column PDFs, so there is one column per page
Description:         Reading two-column academic papers is awkward on the
                     Kindle; you sort of have to choose between zooming way
                     out, so that the text is unreadably small, or zooming in
                     far enough that the text is readable, but mucking around
                     with the arrow navigation keys and never quite centering
                     the text on the page. This program takes two-column papers
                     on standard US-letter size paper and splits them down the
                     middle, producing a PDF with one page for each column. On
                     the Kindle, this makes the text large enough to read while
                     still allowing the convenient, built-in navigation mode.
