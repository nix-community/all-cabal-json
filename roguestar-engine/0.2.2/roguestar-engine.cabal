synopsis:            Sci-fi roguelike (turn-based, chessboard-tiled, role playing) game
description:         Roguestar is a science fiction themed roguelike (turn-based,
                     chessboard-tiled, role playing) game written in Haskell. This package
                     provides the core game engine; you'll probably want to also install the
                     OpenGL client.
                     .
                     This initial release allows you to play one of six alien races.  You begin
                     the game stranded on an alien planet, fighting off an endless hoard of
                     hostile robots.
