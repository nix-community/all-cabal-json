-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Instances of the Algebra.* classes for functions

-- A longer description of the package.
Description: This package provides instances for functions @(k -> a)@ of the classes    
  Absolute, Algebraic, Differential, Field, Lattice, Monoid, Ring and Transcendental
  from the numeric-prelude package. An instance for Additive already comes with the
  original package.
  .
  If @a@ has an instance for one of the classes, then @(k -> a)@ has too. 
  The instances do what you would expect. Values become constant functions:
  .
  @
    zero = const zero
  @
  .
  Unary functions are composed:
  .
  @
    sin f = sin . f
  @
  .
  Binary functions fan out the input and combine both results:
  .
  @
    f + g = \\x -> f x + g x
  @
  .
  You can either import them separately or import @Data.Function.Instances.Algebra@ to
  get them all at once.
