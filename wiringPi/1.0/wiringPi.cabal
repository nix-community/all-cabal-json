-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Access GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi via wiringPi library

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
            This is a Haskell binding to the <http://wiringpi.com/ wiringPi library>,
            which allows you to interface with the GPIO pins on the
            <https://www.raspberrypi.org/ Raspberry Pi>.
            Unlike some other solutions for using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins,
            wiringPi provides access to more advanced features, such as
            enabling the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors.
