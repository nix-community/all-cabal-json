Synopsis:               A simple grammar for building linear equations and inclusive inequalities.
Description:
  This library provides some simple tools for building abstract syntax trees,
  representing linear equations and (inclusive) inequalities. As an example:
  .
  > 12x + 3y - 4z + 12 <= 43x - 7b + 8q
  .
  Would look like...
  .
  > f = (12 :: Double) .*. EVar "x" .+.
  >     (3 :: Double) .*. EVar "y" .+.
  >     (-4 :: Double) .*. EVar "z" .+.
  >     ELit 12
  >     .<=.
  >     (43 :: Double) .*. EVar "x" .+.
  >     (-7 :: Double) .*. EVar "b" .+.
  >     (8 :: Double) .*. EVar "q"
  .
  I've added some overloading functionality, to help ease the verbosity of the
  above statements - an @IsString@ instance, and some other utilities. To pack
  the equation into <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#General_.28or_standard.29_form standard form>,
  use the @sandardForm@ function:
  .
  > stdF = standardForm f
