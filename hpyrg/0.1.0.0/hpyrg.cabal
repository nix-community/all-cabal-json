synopsis:            pyrg utility done right
description:
  hpyrg is a pyrg analog written in Haskell.
  .
  pyrg is an utility which colorizes Python unittest module's unit tests output. It has a few fatal flaws:
  .
  * It cannot into lazy IO
  .
  * It cannot into really verbose colorization
  .
  To address these issues there is hpyrg.
