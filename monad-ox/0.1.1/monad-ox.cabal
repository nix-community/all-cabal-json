synopsis:           Monad for observation extraction
description:
    The library provides an Ox monad and accompanying functions which
    are intended to simplify writing functional expressions over input
    sentence with arbitrary type of token.  Values of such functional
    expressions can be subsequently used as observations in input data
    for sequential classifiers.
