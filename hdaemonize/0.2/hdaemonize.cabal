Synopsis:       utilities for UNIX daemon writing
Description:	Provides two functions that help writing better UNIX daemons,
		daemonize and serviced: daemonize does what a daemon should do
		(forking and closing descriptors), while serviced does that and 
		more (syslog interface, PID file writing, start-stop-restart 
		command line handling, dropping privileges).
