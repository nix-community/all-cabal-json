Version:             0.2
Synopsis:	     F(2^e) math for cryptography
Description:         This library implements polynomials on Binary Fields F(2^e), a subform of Finite Fields F(p^n) also known as Galois Fields GF(p^n).
		     It is intended as a backend for cryptographic use and the code should be timing attack resistant.
