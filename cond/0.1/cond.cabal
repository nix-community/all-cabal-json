Description:
  A very simple library implementing various conditional operations, as well
  as some functions for dealing with conditions in monadic code.
  Feel free to send ideas and suggestions for new conditional operators to the
  maintainer.

  Monadic looping constructs are not included as part of this package, since the
  monad-loops package has a fairly complete collection of them already.
