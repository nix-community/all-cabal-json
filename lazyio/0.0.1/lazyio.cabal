Synopsis:         Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order
Description:
  Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order.
  Running a value of the LazyIO monad in the IO monad is like starting a thread
  which is however driven by its output.
  That is, the LazyIO action is only executed as far as necessary
  in order to provide the required data.
