synopsis:            Smaoin vocabulary definitions of the base framework.
description:
  This package provides Smaoin vocabulary entities for direct access in
  Haskell. There can be many vocabulary packages, but this is the first one. It
  specifically provides entities defined by
  <http://rel4tion.org/projects/kadma Kadma>, i.e. base framework definitions
  such as the concepts of Smaoin itself.
  .
  All the vocabularies are under the "Data.Smaoin.Vocabulary" module, organized
  by namespace, with names based on the English localization. For example, if
  you define an ontology under namespace @hello@, you can place vocabulary
  entities under @Data.Smaoin.Vocabulary.Hello@.
  .
  Vocabulary entity modules should be auto-generated from their source
  documents (mostly written in <http://rel4tion.org/projects/idan Idan>), but
  at this early stage the variable definitions in this package are written
  manually (but based on the Idan sources).
  .
