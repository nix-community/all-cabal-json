Synopsis:       Editline backend module for Shellac
Description:
   This package provides a Shellac backend based on the editline
   library.  editline provides a subset of the functionality
   provided by the GNU readline library.  However, it is licenced
   with a BSD-style license and is therefore suitable for some situations
   where GNU readline is not.  This backend features all the line
   editing capabilities provided by editline.
