Category:       Code generation
Synopsis:       Runtime code generation for x86 machine code
Description:	The package contains the following components:
	.
	* An x86 assembler.  We provide both low-level code generation in
	  module "Harpy.X86CodeGen" as well as a (slightly) higher-level
	  implementation in module "Harpy.X86Assembler", which figures out
	  addressing modes based on an instruction's operand types.
	.
	* An x86 disassembler which knows most of the opcodes available on
	  modern x86 processors and can display its output both in the style
	  used in Intel documents an in AT&T style, like the GNU tools. The
	  disassmbler can be found in module "Harpy.X86Disassembler".
	.
	* Some abstractions over the abovementioned code generation modules,
	  such as automatic label management and code generation
	  combinators (for if-then-else statements, while-loops, functions)
	  (module "Harpy.X86CGCombinators").
	.
	* All the above modules use the code generation monad defined in module
	  "Harpy.CodeGenMonad".
