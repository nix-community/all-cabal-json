name:                applicative-splice
version:             0.0.0.0
synopsis:            Write applicative programs in direct style (generalizes idiom brackets).
description:         This package defines a quasiquoter that lets you write
                     your monadic/applicative programs in direct style, i.e.
                     the style in which you would write it in a
                     language with side effects. Unlike actual side effects,
                     this does not affect purity of the langauge, because it's
                     just a syntactic sugar around the usual (\<$>), (\<*>) and
                     (>>=) functions.
