Name:                assimp
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            The Assimp asset import library

Description:
    Important: Install with
    @cabal install --extra-include-dirs \/usr\/local\/include\/assimp\/@
    Of course use the location of the include files on your system.
    .
    This library provides FFI bindings to the Assimp asset import
    library. It requires Assimp to already be installed. For more
    information about Assimp see the assimp website at
    <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>.
    .
    This release corresponds to Assimp 2.0. When this package stabilizes I
    intend to track new releases of Assimp by also releasing new versions with
    the same version number, but this should be considered a beta release.
    Importing models is currently working. Textures and animations are
    untested.
    .
    Here is a sample program that imports a scene and then outputs the
    information contained in it.
    .
    > module Main where
    > 
    > import System (getArgs)
    > import Graphics.Formats.Assimp
    > 
    > -- Defines the preprocessing we want assimp to perform
    > processing = [ CalcTangentSpace
    >              , Triangulate
    >              , JoinIdenticalVertices
    >              , SortByPType
    >              ]
    > 
    > main = do
    >   args <- getArgs
    >   scene <- importFile (head args) processing
    >   print scene                   -- Outputs all information in the scene
    >   getVersionMajor >>= print     -- Print the major version of assimp
    >   getVersionMinor >>= print     -- Print the minor version of assimp
    >   getVersionRevision >>= print  -- Print the version revision of assimp
    .
