Name:       shelly

Version:     0.8.0.2
Synopsis:    shell-like (systems) programming in Haskell

Description: Shelly provides a single module for convenient
             systems programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX
             shells. Shelly:
             .
               * is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than
                 being a demonstration of elegance.
             .
               * has detailed and useful error messages
             .
               * maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.
             .
               * is modern. It uses Text and system-filepath/system-fileio
             .
             Shelly is originally forked from the Shellish package.
