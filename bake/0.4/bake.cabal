synopsis:           Continuous integration system
description:
    Bake is a continuous integration server, designed for large, productive, semi-trusted teams.
    .
    * /Large teams/ where there are at least several contributors working full-time on a single code base.
    .
    * /Productive teams/ which are regularly pushing code, many times a day.
    .
    * /Semi-trusted teams/ where code does not go through manual code review, but code does need to pass a test suite and perhaps some static analysis. People are assumed not to be malicious, but are fallible.
