-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            An Io interpreter in Haskell.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         Ganymede is an Io interpreter, originally based on Martin "\"vague\"" Sandin's
                     Amalthea, which is an Io interpreter written in OCaml. There are some
                     differences since Amalthea is based on the description of Io found in Raphael
                     Finkel's 1996 book  "Advanced Programming Language Design" (APLD), whereas
                     Ganymede is more faithful to Raph Levien's original 1989 paper.
