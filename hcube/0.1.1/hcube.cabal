name:                 hcube
version:              0.1.1
synopsis:       Virtual Rubik's cube of arbitrary size. 
description:	Provides virtual model of NxNxN Rubik's cube and console visualization for
		2x2x2, 3x3x3 ,4x4x4, and 5x5x5. Console visualization is choosen in the interest
                of portability. Virtual cube can be constructed from the state
		of a physical cube. Support for a two phase algorithm will be given in a future release 
                for cubes of size 3x3x3 to find the smallest number of moves which solve the cube. 
		The Rubik's cube exhibits many non-trival aspects of group theory.

		The package comes with an executable "hcube". 
                Refer to the README file for details.
