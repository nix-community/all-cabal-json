synopsis:       Library for safe (pattern match free) functions
description:
    Partial functions from the base library, such as @head@ and @!!@, modified
    to return more descriptive error messages, programmer defined error messages,
    @Maybe@ wrapped results and default values.
    
    These functions can be used to reduce the number of unsafe pattern matches in
    your code.
