Synopsis:       Simple application for calculating n-grams using Google.
Description:
  An n-gram is a natural language processing technique for determining,
  given a list of words and a phrase, the probability that each of the
  words given will follow in the phrase. The executable provided asks for
  a phrase and a list of alternate ending words. It also asks for the type
  of n-gram to create (e.g., bi-gram, tri-gram). The probability for each
  possible phrase is then calculated using Google search results.
