-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Convenient handling of points on a seamless 2-dimensional plane

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:
        WrapAround helps you perform calculations involving points on a finite,
	unbounded plane, in which objects that move across one edge of the map
	appear on the other. Add points, calculate distance, and so forth
	without worrying about the edge cases and frustrating math mistakes.
