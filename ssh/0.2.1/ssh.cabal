version:             0.2.1
synopsis:            A pure-Haskell SSH server library.
description:
    This package was split from darcsden into its own project; documentation is
    lacking, but you can find example usage here:

        <http://darcsden.com/alex/darcsden/browse/Main.hs>.

    This is not a standalone SSH server - it is intended to be used as
    a library for implementing your own servers that handle requests and
    authorization, etc. Similar to Python's Twisted Conch library.
