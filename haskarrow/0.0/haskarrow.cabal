Name: haskarrow
Version: 0.0
Synopsis: A dialect of haskell with order of execution based on dependency resolution
Description: This haskell preprocessor will allow you to write "haskarrow" code.  Haskarrow is a semi-impertive language.  In a normal imperitive language evaluation happens top to bottom.  In haskarrow, each command is given a set of dependencies.  Commands are then excecuted in order of dependency resolution, those commands that have the fewest dependencies comming before those with the most.
