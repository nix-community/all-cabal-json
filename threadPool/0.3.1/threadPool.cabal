Synopsis:       Runs other programs in the manner of a thread pool
Description:    Takes an optional argument which is the number
    of threads (the default is three).  Give it the commands to run, one
    per line, through standard input.

    You may use blank lines to divide the commands into sections.  The
    commands in a section will not be started until all the commands in
    previous sections are complete.  Each section can be given its own
    thread count.
