Synopsis: like mtl's ReaderT/StateT, but more than one contained value/type.
Description:
  .
  == Introduction
  .
  When using multiple ReaderT's or StateT's in the same monad stack, it becomes
  necessary to lift the operations in order to affect a specific transformer.
  Using heterogenous lists (type level functions), a GADT and a corresponding
  type class, this package provides transformers that remove that necessity:
  MultiReaderT/MultiStateT can contain a heterogenous list of values.
  .
  The type inferred for the getter/setter determines which value is
  read/written.
  .
  == Example
  .
  > simpleExample :: IO ()
  > simpleExample = evalMultiStateT
  >               $ withMultiState 'H'
  >               $ withMultiState "ello, World!"
  >               $ do
  >   -- the monad here is MultiStateT (Cons [Char] (Cons Char Null)) IO
  >   let combinedPrint = do       -- no type signature necessary
  >         c  <- mGet             -- type of mGet inferred to be m Char
  >         cs <- mGet             --              inferred to be m [Char]
  >         lift $ putStrLn (c:cs)
  >   combinedPrint
  >   mSet 'J'                     -- similarly for the setter
  >   combinedPrint
  .
  The output is:
  .
  > Hello, World!
  > Jello, World!
  .
  ( you can find both this and a more complex example
    in an executable in the package. )
  .
  == Error Messages
  .
  If you try to execute an action that requires a specific type in the state,
  but the current state does not contain that type, the error message is
  something like
  .
  > Control.Monad.MultiState.ContainsType Foo Null
  .
  where @Foo@ is the missing type.
  .
  == Known Deficits
  .
  This package currently lacks a complete set of "lifting instances", i.e.
  instance definitions for classes such as mtl's MonadWriter "over" the newly
  introduced monad transformers, as in
  .
  > instance (MonadWriter w m) => MonadWriter w (MultiStateT c m) where ..
  .
  These "lifting instances" would be necessary
  to achieve full compatability with existing transformers. Ping me if you
  find anything specific missing.
