Synopsis:	Compiler for a supercombinator language
Description:    Epic is a simple functional language which compiles to
                reasonably efficient C code, using the Boehm-Demers-Weiser 
	        garbage collector. It is currently used as a back end for 
	        the Idris dependently typed programming language. It is invoked
                as a library, as it is intended as a compiler back end.
