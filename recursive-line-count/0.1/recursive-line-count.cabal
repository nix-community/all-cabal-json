name:                recursive-line-count
version:             0.1
synopsis:            Count lines in files and display them hierarchically
description:
    This program can be used to count lines of code in a program and display
    them hierarchically.  For example, to tally up lines of Haskell code in a
    git repository:
    .
    >git ls-files '*.hs' | recursive-line-count
    .
    More precisely, @recursive-line-count@ takes a list of file names on
    standard input, counts lines in each file, and displays the results in a
    GtkTreeView.
    .
