synopsis:            Size limited temp filesystem based on fuse

description:         ScratchFS is a FUSE-based filesystem which provides a size-limited directory tree. 
                     When the filesystem is mounted, the user provides a maximum size the target directory and all it's 
                     subdirectories may get. All IO operations in the mountdirectory are tracked and the oldest files in the watchdirectory get deleted automatically.
