Version:             0.1.0
Synopsis:            REST service for creating temporary PostgreSQL databases
Description:
  This is a REST service for conveniently creating temporary PostgreSQL
  databases. It is intended for use from tests.
  .
  Simply install, update the configuration INI file to
  suit your setup, and run as a system service (e.g.
  via systemd, upstart or similar) -- see the @SETUP.txt@
  file for details on what is required of the database
  setup.
  .
  Once the service is running you can do a HTTP POST
  to it to create a temporary database. For example,
  .
  > $ curl -d '' http://localhost:8900
  > pg-harness-test:pg-harness-pass@db:5432/temp_ba36rk6rqvs92wbofk55sz5k3pcl0u74x
  .
  The response indicates that the temporary database "@temp_ba36rk6rqvs92wbofk55sz5k3pcl0u74x@"
  has been created on the database server "@db@" (port 5432) and made available
  to the user "@pg-harness-test@" using the password "@pg-harness-pass@".
  .
  The database will automatically be destroyed after a configurable duration,
  though any temporary databases that have not been destroyed when the service
  is stopped will stay around.
  .
  __NOTE__: No attempt has been made to prevent DoS attacks, so you should __NOT__
  run this on any network facing the public Internet. It is only meant for
  development LANs which are firewalled off.
