synopsis:           Riot is an Information Organisation Tool 
description:
    Riot is a tool for keeping (textual) information organised. Some people
    call such programs 'outliners'. It is a todo list and note manager, and
    a manager for whatever information one might collect, that I wrote
    because I couldn't find a single one that was at all close to what I
    wanted. Riot has an interface resembling those of slrn and mutt and all
    text editing is done with an external editor: Riot is simply a
    nice-to-use browser for collections of text.
