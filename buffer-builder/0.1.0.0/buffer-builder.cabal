synopsis:            Library for efficiently building up buffers, one piece at a time
description:

    'BufferBuilder' is an efficient library for incrementally building
    up 'ByteString's, one chunk at a time.  Early benchmarks show it
    is over twice as fast as ByteString Builder, primarily because
    'BufferBuilder' is built upon an ST-style restricted monad and
    mutable state instead of ByteString Builder's monoidal AST.
    .
    Internally, BufferBuilder is backed by a few C functions.
    Examination of GHC's output shows nearly optimal code generation
    with no intermediate thunks -- and thus, continuation passing and
    its associated indirect jumps and stack traffic only occur when
    BufferBuilder is asked to append a non-strict ByteString.
    .
    I benchmarked four major implementations and benchmarked with the buildURL benchmark:
    .
      * State monad, concatenating ByteStrings: __6.98 us__
    .
      * State monad, ByteString Builder: __2.48 us__
    .
      * Crazy explicit RealWorld baton passing with unboxed state: __28.94 us__ (GHC generated really awful code for this, but see the revision history for the technique)
    .
      * C + FFI + ReaderT: __1.11 us__
    .
    Using BufferBuilder is very simple:
    .
    > import qualified Data.BufferBuilder as BB
    > 
    > let byteString = BB.runBufferBuilder $ do
    >       BB.appendBS "http"
    >       BB.appendChar8 '/'
    >       BB.appendBS "//"
