name:           antiquoter
version:        0.1.0.0
synopsis:       Combinator library for quasi- and anti-quoting.
description:    A combinator library to improve the building of anti-quoters.
                Especially aimed at making user extensible antiquoters and
                removing copy-and-paste programming from their definition.
                .
                The modules are
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Base" basic type aliases for
                  building antiquoters.
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat" making antiquoters which
                  can result in expressions as well as patters. Therefore only
                  one antiquoter has to be defined in stead of two.
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Combinators" more useful
                  combinators to use with the functions from
                  "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat".
