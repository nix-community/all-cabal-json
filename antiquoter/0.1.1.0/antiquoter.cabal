name:           antiquoter
version:        0.1.1.0
synopsis:       Combinator library for quasi- and anti-quoting.
description:    A combinator library to improve the building of anti-quoters.
                Especially aimed at removing copy-and-paste programming from
                their definition. Other antiquoting related features could be
                included in the future.
                .
                The modules are
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Base" basic types for building
                   antiquoters. It also contains the most detailed example of
                   the basic usage.
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat" making antiquoters which
                  can antiquote both expressions and patters. Therefore only
                  one antiquoter has to be defined in stead of two.
                .
                * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Combinators" more useful
                  combinators to use with the functions from
                  "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat".
