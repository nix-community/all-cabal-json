name:           utf8-prelude
version:        0.1.2
synopsis:       Prelude and System.IO with UTF8 text I/O
description:    
    utf8-prelude provides variants of "Prelude" and "System.IO" using UTF8 text I/O operations, making 
    UTF8 text I/O even simpler.
    .
    Three simple steps to switch to UTF8 with your Haskell code:
    .
    * In all modules import Prelude explicitly and replace every occurrence of "Prelude" with "UTF8Prelude".
    .
    * Use the NoImplicitPrelude language extension.
    .
    * In all modules replace every occurrence of "System.IO" with "System.UTF8IO".
    .
    utf8-prelude also provides a basic testing tool:
    utf8-test tests the functions readFile, writeFile and putStrLn.
    Note: utf8-test creates a file named writeFile_test.txt in the current working directory.
    .
    utf8-prelude is based on utf8-string:

    .
    This package will be obsolate with GHC if GHC will have porper unicode support for text I/O.
    It is planned beyond GHC 6.10:
