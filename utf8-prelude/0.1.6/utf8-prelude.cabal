name:           utf8-prelude
version:        0.1.6
synopsis:       Variants of Prelude and System.IO with UTF8 text I/O operations
description:    
    If you want your Haskell code to have UTF8 text I/O then use libraries which have UTF8 text I/O.
    In case of Prelude with this package only three mechanical steps needed:
    .
    * In all modules import Prelude explicitly and replace every occurrence of "Prelude" with "UTF8Prelude".
    .
    * Use the NoImplicitPrelude language extension.
    .
    * In all modules replace every occurrence of "System.IO" with "System.UTF8IO".
    .
    utf8-test tests several functions regarding UTF8 text I/O.
    Note: utf8-test creates a file named writeFile_test.txt (5,3K) in the current working directory.
    .
    utf8-prelude is based on utf8-string:

    .
    This package will be obsolete *after* GHC 6.10:
