Synopsis:            A pretty-printer for higher-order logic
Build-Type:          Simple
Description:         
  This is a pretty-printer for higher-order logic (HOL).  It reads in a formula
  and outputs it to standard out.  A paper describes its design and motivation
  at the project website.  The approach expands upon Leslie Lamport's paper, \"How
  to Write a Long Formula,\" available at 
     <http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-howtowrite>.
