  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. It was released 
  to Hackage prematurely - designing a higher-level drawing 
  library turns out to be much more demanding than designing a 
  low-level one (Wumpus-Core). 
  .
  A few of the modules (SafeFonts, SVGColours, X11Colours) are
  fairly stable others simply aren\'t and may even disappear in
  subsequent updates.
  .
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.8.0 to 0.9.0:
  .
  * Re-worked @Basic.Text.LRSymbol@ changed the type name and the
    types of the run functions. Added more symbols and a new demo 
    @Symbols.hs@.
  .
  * @ScalingContext@ added to @Basic.Graphic@. Changed 
    @monoTextWidth@ to take a character count, the old behaviour 
    is recreated by the new function @monoTextLength@. 
  .
  * @Basic.Graphic.Chain@ removed. It is now superseded by
    @Basic.Chains@.
  .
  * Added new property to @DrawingContext@ for line spacing 
    scaling factor, and added a new drawing primitive 
    @textlineMulti@ for multi-line, left justified labels.
  .
  * Synthezied attribute /getters/ such as @textDimensions@ moved
    from @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@ to the new module
    @Basic.Graphic.Query@. The type of all the functions has 
    changed to DrawingF. @lowerxHeight@ is renamed 
    @monoLowerxHeight@ emphasizing that the metrics pertain to
    monospaced Courier font.
  .
  * Added Shapes modules.
  . 
  * TurtleMonad module - the TurtleDrawing type and run functions
    have been removed and the internals have been reworked. 
    Turtle is now run solely as a /local effect/ within the 
    Drawing monad. 
  .
  0.7.0 to 0.8.0:
  .
  * Re-introduced LRText and LRSymbol - they now work with 
    Wumpus-Core\'s kerning support.
  . 
  * Changes to @Graphic.Basic.BaseTypes@ - @DrawingObject@ 
    renamed to @DrawingF@. @HPrim@ wrapped as a newtype to 
    support a Monoid instance. Removed @appendGraphic@ and @gcat@ 
    as they can be achieved with @mappend@ and @mconcat@. 
    @appendAt@ renamed to @lgappend@. @PointT@ remaned to 
    @PointF@.
  .
  * Changes to @Graphic.Basic.Drawing@ - @drawAt@, @drawAtImg@, 
    @drawConn@, @drawConnImg@ all removed. They are replaced 
    by @draw@ and @drawi@ together with then new @at@ and @conn@
    combinators.
  .
  * Changes to @Basic.Graphic.PrimGraphic@ - @localDrawingContext@
    renamed to @localLG@ and moved to @Basic.Graphic.BaseTypes@.
  .
  * Updates to @Basic.SafeFonts@ to work with changes to 
    @Wumpus.Core@.
