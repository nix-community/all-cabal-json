synopsis:         Basic objects and system code built on Wumpus-Core.
description:
  .
  Kernel code for higher-level drawing built on Wumpus-Core.
  This package provides font loader code (limited to AFM font 
  files) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a 
  higher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives 
  (paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core. 
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is alpha grade and it is 
  strongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is 
  sub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they
  will have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs 
  polishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of
  work to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to 
  being readily usable. 
  .
  .
  NOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the
  package @Wumpus-Drawing@.

  Changelog:
  .
  v0.15.0 to v0.16.0:
  .
  * Moved the Geometry modules from Wumpus-Drawing into 
    Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  * Re-worked the @CtxPicture@ API, although the current naming 
    scheme is not satisfactory.
  .
  * Added extra Anchor classes.
  .
  * Added @PosImage@ object - this is a rectangle-framed object 
    that can be drawn from any of its corners or its center. 
  .
  * Added @Displacement@ module. This defines the @PointDisplace@
    type and provides a library of @PointDisplace@ functions.
    Note - some of the new functions have taken names previously 
    used for anchor projection functions (@northwards@, 
    @southwards@, etc.), anchor projections are now build with the 
    function @projectAnchor@.
  .
  * Added the property @descender@ to the font metrics.
  .
  * Split drawing primitives from type in @Objects.Graphic@, 
    drawing primitives are now in the module 
    @Objects.DrawingPrimitives@.
  .
  v0.14.0 to v0.15.0:
  . 
  * Split previous @Wumpus-Basic@ package into two packages:
    @Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@. This is a pratical move 
    to separate the developed (although not yet polished) @Kernel@ 
    and @FontLoader@ code from the prototypical @Drawing@ code.
  .
  * Renamed the @Drawing@ object to @CtxPicture@. Although 
    @CtxPicture@ is a less pleasant name, it should be less 
    confusing. A @CtxPicture@ is the essentially the @Picture@ 
    type from Wumpus-Core with an implicit context - 
    @ContextPicture@ is simply too long and @CtxPicture@ is 
    almost jibberish but the previous unrelated name @Drawing@ 
    was not helpful.
  .
  * @Kernel.Base.ScalingContext@ has been simplified. 
    ScalingContexts are no longer manipulated via a custom Reader
    monad or transformer as the type signatures were too unwieldy.
  .
  * Added @TextMargin@ to the @DrawingContext@ - Wumpus-Drawing 
    can now calculate more appealing bounding boxes for text.
  .
