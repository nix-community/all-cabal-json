description:
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. It was released 
  to Hackage prematurely - designing a higher-level drawing 
  library turns out to be much more demanding than designing a 
  low-level one (Wumpus-Core). 
  .
  A few of the modules (SafeFonts, SVGColours, X11Colours) are
  fairly stable others simply aren\'t and may even disappear in
  subsequent updates.
  .
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.6.0 to 0.7.0:
  .
  * Major rework of Graphic types, the old types (AGraphic, 
    GraphicF etc.) and the old drawing monads have been removed. 
    The new types are based on the AGraphic and related types but 
    their implementation is different. The new types track the 
    /graphics state/ within the type (the DrawingContext) plus 
    how to draw themselves. For real drawings, graphics are 
    collected with a Writer-like monad the @Basic.Graphic.Drawing@ 
    monad which replaces the DrawingCtx and Trace monads. The 
    Turtle monad remains and has been updated to work with the new
    drawing monads.
  .
  * LRText and LRSymbol modules temporarily removed as they 
    contradict the new, optimized kerning functionality in 
    @Wumpus.Core@.
  .
  0.5.0 to 0.6.0:
  .
  * Updates to work with wumpus-core-0.30.0.
  .
  * The code from @Basic.Graphic@ has been moved in to 
    @Basic.Graphic.Primitive@ - this module is due a major 
    overhaul. @Basic.Graphic@ is now an /import/ shim for
    @Basic.Graphic.Primitive@.
  .
  0.4.0 to 0.5.0:
  .
  * Re-worked the PictureLanguage module.
  .
  * SVGColours and X11Colours moved into @Wumpus.Basic.Colour@.
    Naming scheme for colours changed to use underscore between 
    words rather than camelCase.
  .
  * Updates to work with wumpus-core-0.30.0.
