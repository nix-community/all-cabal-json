  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. It was released 
  to Hackage prematurely - designing a higher-level drawing 
  library turns out to be much more demanding than designing a 
  low-level one (Wumpus-Core). 
  .
  Some of the modules (SafeFonts, SVGColours, X11Colours) are
  relatively stable. The core modules of @Basic.Graphic@ (@Base@,
  @PrimGraphic@, @DrawingContext@) seem to support a good set
  primitive functions, but the exact types of drawing objects do 
  not feel right at the moment. Other modules (Paths, Chains, 
  Shapes) are essentially sketches and are expected to be
  substantially revised in subsequent updates.
  .
  Version 0.11.0 is an interim release. It is expected that the 
  next release will substantially rework Shapes and likely change
  the @Graphic.Base@ types. As quite a large amount of code has 
  already changed since version 0.10.0 (to support better 
  arrowheads and connectors) it seems sensible to release 0.11.0 
  now, rather than have a huge delta after Shapes have been 
  reworked again. The current versions of @Wumpus-Tree@ and 
  @Wumpus-Microprint@ will work with version 0.11.0 if their 
  respective @.cabal@ files are edited to bump the version number. 
  There will be no matching releases to work automatically with 
  version 0.11.0 of Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.10.0 to 0.11.0:
  . 
  * Reworked arrowheads and connectors - connectors are now 
    configurable: there are functions to make connectors with 
    a left arrowhead, right arrowhead, none or both.  
  .
  * Reworked shapes - internally shapes now create a @Path@ rather 
    than a @Graphic@ this means the path can be manipulated (e.g. 
    round cornered rectangles, diamonds... can be constructed).
    @Coordinate@ is no longer a @Shape@ - it is now similar object 
    but of a different type. Likewise, @FreeLabel@ has been 
    replaced by @Plaintext@ which is not a @Shape@, but has some 
    similar properties. Unfortunately, the Shape types are still 
    difficult to work with and a larger reworking is still 
    necessary.
  .
  * @Basic.Paths.Base@ - @Path@ type changed, @PathEmpty@ 
    constructor removed so empty paths cannot be created. This 
    allows a better API for taking points on a path. It also 
    means @Path@ is no longer an instance of Monoid. Type changes 
    to various functions (e.g. @tipR@, @tipL@) reflecting that as 
    paths cannot now be empty, functions on them can generally be 
    total. @toPrimPathU@ removed as converting to a PrimPath as 
    now always /safe/. @tracePoints@ renamed @traceLinePoints@, 
    @tracePointsCurve@ renamed @traceCurvePoints@, @midpoint@ 
    renamed @midway@.
  .
  * @Basic.Graphic@ - the types @ConnDrawingR@, @ConnGraphic@ etc.
    have had their names expanded to @ConnectorDrawingR@, 
    @ConnectorGraphic@... 
  .
  * @Basic.SafeFont@ - font names changed to use underscore 
    separators rather than camelCase. Wumpus generally uses 
    underscored names for /constants/.
  .
  * Removed @conn@ from @Basic.Graphic.Drawing@. Connectors should 
    be used instead.
  .
  * The class @DrawingCtxM@ now has @Applicative@ as a superclass. 
  .
  * @lineSpacing@ renamed @baselineSpacing@.
