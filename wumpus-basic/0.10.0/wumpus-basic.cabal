  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. It was released 
  to Hackage prematurely - designing a higher-level drawing 
  library turns out to be much more demanding than designing a 
  low-level one (Wumpus-Core). 
  .
  Some of the modules (SafeFonts, SVGColours, X11Colours) are
  relatively stable. The core modules of @Basic.Graphic@ (@Base@,
  @PrimGraphic@, @DrawingContext@) are quite weather-beaten if 
  not exactly stable, although the newer modules 
  (@ScalingContext@, @DirectionContext@) are still quite green.
  Other modules (Paths, Chains, Shapes) are essentially sketches 
  and may be radically different in subsequent updates.
  .

  Changelog:
  .
  0.9.0 to 0.10.0:
  .
  * @Basic.Graphic.BaseClasses@ and @Basic.Graphic.BaseTypes@ 
    merged into same module so they can depend on each other 
    without orphans instances.
  .
  * @DrawingF@ renamed to @DrawingR@, the related type synonyms
    have also been changed, e.g. @LocDrawingF@ is now 
    @LocDrawingR@.
  .
  * Method names in the @DrawingCtxM@ class changed - @askCtx@ is
    now @askDC@, @localCtx@ is now @localize@. Removed the 
    functions @askDF@, @asksDF@, @pureDF@ that worked for 
    @DrawingF@ (now @DrawingR@), @DrawingR@ now uses the 
    Applicative\'s @pure@ and the @DrawingCtxM@ class for these 
    functionalities.
  .
  * @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@ - renamed @primary_colour@ to
    @stroke_colour@ and @secondary_colour@ to @fill_colour@. The 
    setter functions has been similarly renamed.
  .
  * Added the type synonym @DrawingContextF@ to 
    @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@. Changed relevant function
    signatures to use it.
  .
  * Re-worked the Path modules - base types entirely different,
    connectors entirely different, monadic path construction 
    largely the same.
  .
  * Initial work on round cornered paths.
  . 
  * Removed the type class @TextAnchor@ from @Basic.Anchors@. 
    This was a left-over from a previous implementation of 
    Shapes and is not relevant to the current implementation.
  . 
  * Added @DirectionContext@ to @Basic.Graphic@.
  .
  * @localLG@ removed it can be acheived with composition -
    @localize upd . loc_graphic_function@. @lgappend@ is also 
    removed - it can be recreated applicatively.
