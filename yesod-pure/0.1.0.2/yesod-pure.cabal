synopsis:            Yesod in pure Haskell: no Template Haskell or QuasiQuotes (deprecated)
description:         NOTE: Most of the concepts from this package have made it into yesod-core itself since the 1.2 release. Please see <http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/03/yesod-dispatch-version-1-2> for more information, or search the Haddocks for @LiteApp@.
                     .
                     Provides helper functions to simplify programming of Yesod without any code generation or non-Haskell DSLs. Mainly, this is focused on the routing quasi-quoter, though some templating help is provided as well.
