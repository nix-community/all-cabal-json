synopsis: Phonetic codes: Soundex and Phonix
description: 

   This package implements the "phonetic coding" algorithms
   Soundex and Phonix.  A phonetic coding algorithm
   transforms a word into a similarity hash based on an
   approximation of its sounds.  Thus, similar-sounding
   words tend to have the same hash.
