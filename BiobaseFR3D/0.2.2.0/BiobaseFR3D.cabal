description:
                Provides importers for FR3D resource files. Of particular
                interest are basepairs files which describe canonical and
                non-canonical (non-Watson-Crick) base pairings in RNA secondary
                structure.
                .
                The original FR3D paper is:

                Changes since any 0.1.*:
                .
                * Zero-based indexing (FR3D is one-based!) for sequence
                  positions. We do not change the nucleotide PDB number.
                .
                * Some sanity checks, a number of FR3D files fall through at
                  this and need to be checked for consistency
