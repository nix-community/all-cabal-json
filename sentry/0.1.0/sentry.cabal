synopsis:            Process monitoring tool written and configured in Haskell
description:
  Sentry is a process monitoring tool written and configured in Haskell. Its
  aim is to keep running programs. For each configured program, multiple
  processes can be started. Currently Sentry runs on Linux only.
  .
  Under normal circumstance, the "Sentry" module is enough to write
  configuration files.
