Synopsis:       Binary and exponential searches
Description:    These modules address the problem of finding the boundary
                of an upward-closed set of integers, using a combination
                of exponential and binary searches.  Variants are provided
                for searching within bounded and unbounded intervals of
                both 'Integer' and bounded integral types.
Exposed-Modules:
                Numeric.Search.Bounded
                Numeric.Search.Integer
                Numeric.Search.Range
