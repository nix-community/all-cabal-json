description:        A quasiquoter for Text.Regex.PCRE regexes.
                    This makes use of a new GHC extension known as QuasiQuotes.
                    QuasiQuotes do not appear in ghc until 6.9, BUT there is a
                    patch for ghc-6.8.3 which adds quasiquote functionality. A
                    patched version of ghc-6.8.3, made possible by audreyt's patch, is at
                    <http://code.haskell.org/~morrow/quasiquotes/ghc-6.8.3_QQ-0.1.tar.bz2>.
                    An example of the use of @regexqq@ is located at
                    <http://code.haskell.org/~morrow/quasiquotes/regexqq.txt>
