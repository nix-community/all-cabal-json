Synopsis:       Transactional variables and data structures with IO hooks
Description:
    This package provides STM data structures with IO hooks. 
    The basic building blocks are instances of class 'TBox'. Such an
    instance is an STM variable that might contain a value of 
    some type 'a'. In contrast to a plain 'TVar (Maybe a)', a 
    'TBox' has IO hooks that are executed transparently on writes and reads.
        The IO hooks of the 'AdvSTM' monad extend the atomicity of STM transactions
    to the on-commit IO actions, which makes it particularly suitable for 
    implementing a persistent and thread-safe storage.
    .
    See module Control.Concurrent.TFile for a (simple) instance of a 'TBox'
    that serializes its content to a file via 'Data.Binary'.
    .
    New in this release is the implementation of a skip list in module
    Control.Concurrent.TBox.TSkipList. A skip list is a probabilistic data
    structure that provides expected run time of /O(log n)/ for 
    dictionary operations (insert, lookup, filter, delete, update) similar to 
    a balanced tree. 
    The main advantage of a skip list is that it does not need rebalancing,
    which could cause lots of contention among transactions.
    The 'TFile' skip list instance tries to reconstruct its content from the
    'TFile'-directory. See module Control.Concurrent.TFile.TSkipList for a
    usage example.
    .
    Feedback is highly appreciated!
