synopsis:            An reflex interface for gloss.
description:         This package exports a simple wrapper, in terms of
                     Graphics.Gloss.Interface.IO.Game, that allows full
                     control of the picture generated by Gloss as a
                     Behavior, as well as providing access to
                     Gloss' clock and input-handling functionality as
                     Events.
