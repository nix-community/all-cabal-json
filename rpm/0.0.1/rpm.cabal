-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Cozy little project to question unruly rpm packages.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         RPM is a decent system for listing dependencies among packages.  In its simplest form it works quite well.  Dependency management can become troublesome if you have a system that provides numerous packages.  Worse yet, if you provide many packages for many different versions of a software application.  This library aims to provide a rich set of combinators to assert the validity of a collection of RPMs.
