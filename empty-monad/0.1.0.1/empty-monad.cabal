name:                empty-monad
version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            A container that always has no values.
description:
    Like arithmetics is incomplete without zero, set theory is impossible without
    a notion of an empty set, algorithm theory must take into account totally
    undefined functions -- so the domain of data types needs its absolute zero.

    'Void' type from the @void@ package <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/void>
    provides a zero element for the kind @*@ of unparametrized types. This package
    does the same for the kind @*->*@ of types with one parameter.
