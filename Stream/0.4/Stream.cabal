Synopsis:               A library for manipulating infinite lists.
Description:            This package implements functions, analogous
                        to those from Data.List, to create and manipulate
			infinite lists: @data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)@.
			It provides alternative definitions for those
			Prelude functions that make sense for such streams. 
			Note that this package has (almost) 
			nothing to do with the work on /Stream Fusion/ by 
			Duncan Coutts, Roman Leshchinskiy, and Don Stewart.
