Synopsis:       A library for creating Shockwave Flash (SWF) files
Description: Provides Haskell datatypes which closely reflect the
 internal specification of SWF, and routines to convert the data
 values into a valid .swf file. Currently the assembly language
 portion is best supported, with many other features missing, such as
 images, sounds, and much more.
