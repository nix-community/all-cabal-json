synopsis: Timers, timeouts, alarms, monadic wrappers
description:
    This library provides several timer and timeout related tools:
    .
    * "Control.Timeout" - Execution of a computation with a time limit, aborting
    it if the limit is reached before the computation finishes. It is
    more-or-less a lifted version of "System.Timeout" from the @base@ package.
    It's good for single use, but it launches a temporary helper thread. If you
    want to time-limit actions continuously (e.g. if you're implementing a
    network protocol), you should probably use one of the other tools described
    below, since they use a single dedicated thread for all the timeouts.
    .
    * "Control.Timer" - Managing a timer running in a dedicated thread. The timer
    waits for an amount of time you specify, and then runs an action you
    specify. You can stop and restart it at any time.
    .
    * "Control.Alarm" - Managing an alarm, which is a timer whose action is to
    notify your thread when the specified amount of time passes.
    .
    * "Control.Monad.Trans.Timer" - A monad transformer for managing a timer
    .
    * "Control.Monad.Trans.Alarm" - A monad transformer for managing an alarm
    .
    * "Control.Monad.Trans.Timeout" - A monad transformer for running actions
    with timeouts, useful for e.g. network protocols where any send and receive
    can timeout
    .
    * "Control.Monad.Timeout.Class" - A monad typeclass for running actions with
    a time limit. "Control.Timeout" provides a simple trivial for IO (which can
    then be used with any @MonadIO@), and "Control.Monad.Trans.Timeout"
    provides a scalable instance.
