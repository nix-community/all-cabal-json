synopsis: Execute a computation with a timeout
description:
    This simple library allows you to execute a computation with a limit on its
    running time. If it finishes within the specified limit, you get the result
    it returns. Otherwise, i.e. if it doesn't finish in time, it will be aborted
    and you'll be notified.
