Name:          linearEqSolver
Version:       1.0
Category:      Math, SMT
Synopsis:      Solve linear systems of equations over integers.
Description:   Express and solve linear systems of equations over integers, using an SMT solver to do the actual solving.
               By default, we use Microsoft's Z3 SMT solver (<http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/>).
               .
               You can get a single solution if it exists. Or ask for all possible solutions for underspecified
               systems, which will be lazily returned in a list.
               .
