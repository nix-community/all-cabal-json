synopsis:            Workaround for GHC bug #2189.
description:         This package exists as a workaround for GHC bug #2189, \"@hSetBuffering stdin
                     NoBuffering@ doesn't work on Windows\". It provides functionality for reading
                     from standard input without buffering, in a way that works under GHC on
                     Windows as well as other configurations. This is useful for key-driven console
                     applications such as roguelikes.
