description:
                A data structure for Mathews / Turner RNA and DNA energy
                parameters. This library currently only provides an importer,
                not export functions. There are two reasons: (i) We currently
                have no use-case where we need more than import facilities (ii)
                The file structure is geared towards humans, not machines. If
                you need to be able to export, send a mail.
                .
                This is the 2011 post-library split version, hence not
                deprecated anymore.
