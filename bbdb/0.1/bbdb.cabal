-- A longer description of the package.

Description:         BBDB (http://sourceforge.bbdb.net) is a contact management utility
                     that can be used with emacs.  It stores its data internally as a lisp
                     expression.  This module parses the lisp and provides some convenience
                     functions to get at and manipulate the data all from within Haskell.
                     See the hackage docs for usage and examples.
