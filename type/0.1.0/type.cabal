synopsis: Dynamic casting library with support for arbitrary rank type kinds.
description:
  Originally written out of need to write Typeable instances for monad transformers. This is troublesome since monad transformer type constructors have by definition at least rank 2 kind.

  By default only type constructors whose kind contains maximum of 8 units are supported, for example: @ * -> (* -> *) -> ((* -> *) -> *) -> * -> * @.
  The provided generator allows one to support even more complex types.
  However be aware that the amount of code generated increases exponentially.
