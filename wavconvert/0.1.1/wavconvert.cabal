version:             0.1.1
synopsis:            Command-line tool for converting audio files and filling in ID3 tags
description:         This program is useful for turning a directory tree of .wav files 
                     (presumably created by a CD ripping program) into a tree of .ogg
	             files with proper metadata. It is meant to be run on a directory tree 
                     in which the directory structure is organized according to
                     the artist and album names. It runs an .ogg encoder (which is 
                     assumed to be installed) and sets the metadata in the resulting
                     .ogg files based on the directory organization. (See the README
                     for examples.) It would be easy to adapt the code to generate
	             .mp3 files instead of .ogg, or to use a different encoder
	             (currently the "oggenc" program is assumed.)
