synopsis: Lightweight replacement for Plugins, specific to GHC
description:
  The Plugins package unfortunately does not work on GHC 6.12, and is at any rate
  rather poorly documented.  This package uses the same general strategy but without
  quite as many options, aiming to be simple and useful rather than complete.  This
  release renames load to unsafeLoad and adds loadDynamic, which is type-safe.
