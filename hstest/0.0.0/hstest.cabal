Tested-With:    GHC == 6.10.1
Category:       Testing
Synopsis:       Tests properties in specified modules via QuickCheck; uses GHC api for speed
Description:
 .
 'hstest' looks through all Haskell source files in the current directory (by default), finds all properties to test (properties
 must have a name that starts 'prop_'), and runs them via QuickCheck.
 .
 For example, suppose you have this Haskell source file called 'mysort.hs':
 .
 > mySort xs = ... -- a function you wish to test (definition elided)
 >
 > prop_lengthStaysTheSame xs = length xs == length (mySort xs)
 > prop_sumStaysTheSame xs = sum xs == sum (mySort xs)
 > prop_lowestElementAtStart, prop_highestElementAtEnd :: [Int] -> Bool
 > prop_lowestElementAtStart xs = not (null xs) ==> minimum xs = head (mySort xs)
 > prop_highestElementAtEnd xs = not (null xs) ==> maximum xs = last (mySort xs)
 .
 Then to check all these tests, you run
 .
 > $ hstest
 > Failed prop_highestElementAtEnd:
 >  *  [-3,2,-2]
 > mysort.hs: Failed 1 property, passed 3 properties
 .
 Oops! Fix 'mySort' and try again:
 .
 > $ hstest
 > mysort.hs: Passed 4 properties
