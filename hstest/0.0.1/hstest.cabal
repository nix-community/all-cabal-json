Category:               Testing
Synopsis:               Runs tests via QuickCheck1 and HUnit; like quickCheck-script but uses GHC api
Description:
 .
 'hstest' looks through all Haskell source files in the current directory (by default), runs all properties via QuickCheck 1
 (properties must have a name that starts 'prop_'), and runs all tests via HUnit (tests must have a name that starts 'test_').
 .
 For example, suppose you have this Haskell source file called 'mysort.hs':
 .
 > mySort xs = ... -- a function you wish to test (definition elided)
 >
 > prop_lengthStaysTheSame xs = length xs == length (mySort xs)
 > prop_sumStaysTheSame xs = sum xs == sum (mySort xs)
 > prop_lowestElementAtStart, prop_highestElementAtEnd :: [Int] -> Bool
 > prop_lowestElementAtStart xs = not (null xs) ==> minimum xs == head (mySort xs)
 > prop_highestElementAtEnd xs = not (null xs) ==> maximum xs == last (mySort xs)
 .
 Then to check all these tests, you run
 .
 > $ hstest
 > Failed prop_highestElementAtEnd:
 >  *  [-3,2,-2]
 > mysort.hs: Failed 1 property, passed 3 properties
 .
 Oops! Fix 'mySort' and try again:
 .
 > $ hstest
 > mysort.hs: Passed 4 properties
