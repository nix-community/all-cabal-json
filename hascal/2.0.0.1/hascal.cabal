version:       2.0.0.1
synopsis:      A minimalistic but extensible and precise calculator
description:   Hascal is both a simple but extendable calculator library for
               Haskell as well as a command-line program using this library.
               .
               Hascal supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
               exponentiation, and logarithm, while it's easy to add custom
               operators.
               .
               Hascal also supports complex numbers. Hascal can work at an
               arbitrary precision. However, Hascal does not support
               parenthesis.
