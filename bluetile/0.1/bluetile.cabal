synopsis:            A modern tiling window manager with a gentle learning curve
description:
  Bluetile is a tiling window manager for X based on xmonad. Windows are arranged
  automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
  screen use. Bluetile's focus lies on making the tiling paradigm easily
  accessible for users coming from traditional window managers by drawing
  on known conventions and making all features available using the mouse.
  It also tries to be usable 'out of the box', making configuration unnecessary.
