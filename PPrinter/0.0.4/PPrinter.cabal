-- A longer description of the package.
description: 

  A library that supports deriving of pretty printing functions on data types.
  .
  The interfaces of pretty printer used are based on that introduced in the paper:
  Philip Wadler, A Prettier Printer, The Fun of Programming, 
  Cornerstones of Computing (2003): 223-243. 
  <http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf original paper>
  .
  The form of generic feature used is based on that introduced in the paper:
  Magalhaes, et al., A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell,
  3'rd ACM Symposium on Haskell, pp. 37-48, September 2010,
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1863523.1863529>.
  The necessary information of implementation of GHC.Generics is described here:
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/GHC-Generics.html#g:1>.
  .
  The implementation of deriving part of API is based on that designed in the library:
