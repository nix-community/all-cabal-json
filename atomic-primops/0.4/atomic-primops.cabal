Synopsis: A safe approach to CAS and other atomic ops in Haskell.

Description:

  After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it's
  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
  based on the concept of "Tickets".
 .
  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to
  add access to other variants that may be of
  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
 .
 Changes in 0.3:
 .
 * Major internal change.  Duplicate the barrier code from the GHC RTS and thus 
   enable support for executables that are NOT built with '-threaded'.
 .
 Changes in 0.4:
 . 
 * Further internal changes, duplicate 'cas' routine well as barriers.  
 .
 * Add `fetchAddByteArrayInt`
 .
 * Add an `Unboxed` counter variant that uses movable "ByteArray"s on the GHC heap.
