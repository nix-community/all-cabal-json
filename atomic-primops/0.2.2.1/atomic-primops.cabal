Synopsis: A safe approach to CAS and other atomic ops in Haskell.

Description:

  WARNING: Your program MUST be built with "ghc -threaded" if you depend on this library.
           The library depends on threaded Haskell RTS, which is only conditionally linked.
           If you don't do this you will see an error at link time about "cas" being missing.
  . 
  After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it's
  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
  based on the concept of "Tickets".
 .
  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to
  add access to other variants that may be of
  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
