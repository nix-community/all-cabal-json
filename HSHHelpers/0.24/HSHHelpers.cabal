Description: 

  Functions I found I was using repeatedly when doing shell programming with HSH.

  Rather than duplicate code, released on hackage.

  A lot of this is cruft. For instance, you are probably better off having a look at System.Posix.Files and
  System.Posix.Users, which I overlooked when writing, before making too much use of hsh helpers. 

Synopsis: Convenience functions that use HSH, instances for HSH.
