Description:
    haskdogs is a small shellscript-like tool which creates tag file for entire
    haskell project directory. It takes into account first-level dependencies by
    recursively scanning imports and adding matching packages to the final
    tag list.

    As a result, programmer can use his/her text editor supporting tags (vim, for
    example) to jump directly to definition of any standard or foreign function
    he/she uses.

    Note, that haskdogs calls some Unix shell commands like 'test' or 'mkdir' via
    SHS so this tool will probably work on Linuxes and maybe Macs. Pure Windows
    will fail to run it.
