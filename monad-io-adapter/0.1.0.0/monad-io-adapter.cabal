synopsis:       Adapters between MonadIO and MonadBase IO.
description:    This package provides utilities for converting between computations
                parameterized via two different typeclasses 'MonadIO' and 'MonadBase', both of
                which can be used to abstract over monad transformer stacks with 'IO' at the
                base. Unfortunately, both classes are frequently used in the Haskell
                ecosystem, since they have minor differences.
                .
                Due to these typeclasses being unrelated, itâ€™s not entirely uncommon to end up
                with type signatures like @('MonadIO' m, 'MonadBaseControl' 'IO' m) => ...@,
                which are a little silly, since @'MonadBaseControl' 'IO'@ really includes all
                the power of 'MonadIO'.
                .
                To help alleviate this problem, this package provides a set of utilities for
                converting between the two constraints in situations where possible.
