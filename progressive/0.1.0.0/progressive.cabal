synopsis:            Multilabel classification model which learns sequentially (online).
description:         Progressive is a multilabel classification model which learns
                     sequentially (online). The set of labels need not be known in advance:
                     the learner keeps a constantly updated set of top N most frequent
                     labels seen so far and predicts labels from this set.
