Description:
        Includes functions for checking the host platform, running tests, capturing output,
        handling errors, comparing runtimes against a baseline, sending mail, running events to a schedule etc.

	Some of these functions are just wrappers around shell commands, so be careful about passing
	them weirdly formed arguments.
