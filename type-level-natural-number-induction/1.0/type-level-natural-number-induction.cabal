Synopsis:            High-level combinators for performing inductive operations.
Description:         This package provides high-level combinators for working
		     with inductive structures --- that is, structures tagged
                     with a phantom type-level natural number.  Combinators
		     are provided for building up a structure from seed data
		     using induction, tearing down a structure to obtain a
		     result, and inductively transforming one structure into
		     another with the same size.
		     .
		     This package uses the type-level-natural-number package for
		     its type-level representations of the natural numbers.  The
		     only non-Haskell 2010 extension it needs is Rank2Types.
