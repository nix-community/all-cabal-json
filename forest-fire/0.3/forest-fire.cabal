synopsis:            Recursively delete CloudFormation stacks and their dependants
description:
  This simple tool will repeatedly query CloudFormation
  stacks for outputs, and see if any other stacks are
  importing those.  This is to make it easier to tear down
  CFn stacks which have many other stacks depending on
  their outputs.
