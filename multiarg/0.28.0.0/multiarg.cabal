description: multiarg is a parser combinator library to build command
 line parsers. With it you can easily create parsers with options
 that take more than one option argument--for example, I created
 multiarg due to the apparent lack of such ability amongst other
 parsers. Its basic design is loosely inspired by Parsec.
 .
 Provides Parser, a monad you use to build parsers. This monad exposes
 multiarg's full functionality. The library also has a simple,
 pre-built parser built with the underlying combinators, which works
 for many situtations and shields you from the underlying complexity
 if you don't need it.
 .
 See the documentation in the Multiarg module for
 details.
