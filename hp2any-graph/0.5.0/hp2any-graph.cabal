Name:          hp2any-graph
Version:       0.5.0
Cabal-Version: >= 1.2
Synopsis:      Real-time heap graphing utility and profile stream server with a reusable graphing module.
Category:      profiling, development, utils
Description:

  This package contains two utilities: a grapher that can display heap
  profiles in real time both for local and remote processes, and a
  relay application the grapher connects to in the latter case.
  Additionally, the graphing capability is exposed to other programs
  as well in the form of a library module.
