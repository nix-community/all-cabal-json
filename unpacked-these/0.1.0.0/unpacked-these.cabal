name:                unpacked-these
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            An unpacked these data type
description:
  The 'These' type and associated operations. 
  .
  This module is intended to be a drop-in(*) replacement for /Data.These/. To shave off pointer chasing, it uses -XUnboxedSums to represent the 'These' type as two machine words that are contiguous in memory, without loss of expressiveness that 'These' provides.
  .
  This library provides pattern synonyms This, That, and Both(*), which allow users to pattern match on an Unpacked These in a familiar way.
  . 
  Functions are also provided for converting an Unpacked These to the these library's These, and vice versa.
  .
  (*): pattern synonyms use the same namespace as type constructors, so pattern matching on an Unpacked These with the more familiar 'These' data constructor is not possible, instead, Both is provided.
  . 
  This library is in alpha, and the internals are likely to change.
