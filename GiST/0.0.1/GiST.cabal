synopsis:               A Haskell implementation of a Generalized Search Tree (GiST)
description:            A simple implementation of the GiST data structure, including a couple of basic
                        predicates used for implementing a GiST based B+ or R-tree. The GiST is also
                        capable und working with any user defined instance of the class Predicates,
                        making this package perfect for developing and testing new types of balanced 
                        trees.
