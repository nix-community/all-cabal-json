Synopsis:       Implementation of the SKI combinators as an interactive graph rewriting system
Description:
	This package serves as an example for how to use the graph-rewriting, graph-rewriting-layout, and graph-rewriting-gl packages to create a graph rewriting system with an interactive, graphical front-end. The sources are well documented and can used as a tutorial for implementing your own rewrite system. Start reading in Graph.hs
