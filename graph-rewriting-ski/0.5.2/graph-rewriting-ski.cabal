Synopsis:       Two implementations of the SKI combinators as interactive graph rewrite systems
Description:
	This package serves as an example for how to use the graph-rewriting, graph-rewriting-layout, and graph-rewriting-gl packages to create a graph rewriting system with an interactive, graphical front-end. The SKI combinator calculus is implemented once as an interaction net with combinators that accumulate their arguments, and once in a more direct manner. The sources (of the interaction net implementation) are well documented and serve as a tutorial for implementing your own rewrite system. Start reading in INet/Graph.hs. To run the program run either the "ski-inet" or the "ski-direct" command with one of the files in the "examples" directory as an argument.
