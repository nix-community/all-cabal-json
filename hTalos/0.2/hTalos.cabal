synopsis:            Parser, print and manipulate structures in PDB file format.
description:         Protein Data Bank file format is a most popular format for holding biomolecule data. This is a very fast parser (below 7s for the largest entry in PDB - 1HTQ which is over 70MB - as compared with 11s of RASMOL 2.7.5, or 2m15s of BioPython with Python 2.6 interpreter.) It is aimed to not only deliver event-based interface, but also a high-level data structure for manipulating data in spirit of BioPython's PDB parser.
