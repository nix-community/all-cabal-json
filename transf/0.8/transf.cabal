description: 
    Transf is functional text transformer and interpreter. 
    .
    It scans its input for guard tokens and passes everything between to transformation functions. Transformation functions are composed from a small set of combinators and may perform arbirary Haskell computation. Transf contains a full Haskell interpeter and can even interpret its input as Haskell. 
    .
    The main purpose of Transf is to allow the embedding of Domain-Specific Languages in plain text or Markdown files. For example one could use it with Diagrams as follows:
    .
    > This is my file. Here is an image:
    > 
    > ~~~diagram "A circle!"
    > circle <> stretchX 2 square
    > ~~~
    .
    Transf can then generate the image, and replace the source in the text file with the name of the actual image. It can also include the source.
    .
    > This is my file. Here is an image:
    > 
    > ![A circle](a22b15efb10b.png)
    >
    .
    You can supply your own file names. In the above example, the file name is a hash of the source code.
