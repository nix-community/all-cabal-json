Synopsis:            Type-level (low cardinality) integers.
Description:
    This package provides unary type level representations of the
    (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, division) on these.
    Due to the unary implementation the practical size of the
    NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable for
    large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with
    integers beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn't for you.
    It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as
    representing physical dimensions (see the 'Dimensional' library).
