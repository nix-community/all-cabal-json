Version:                0.2.0.0
Category:               Data Structures
Synopsis:               Efficient pure ternary tree Sets and Maps
Description:            Ternary trees are an efficient structure often used for storing
			strings for fast lookups. This package implements a generic tree
			for storing lists of Ord instances, and a specialised String
			implementation which is about 30% faster than the generic version.
			.
			An example program is provided what shows how to use the package
			as a dictionary program for spell checking, and how it can be 
			used to serialise data with Don Stewart's Data.Binary package.
			.
			From my testing, using the \/usr\/share\/dict\/words file on my system
			(over 230,000 words), inserting all words, checking they all exist
			in the tree, writing them to a binary file, reading them back in
			and checking the read in result is the same as the original takes
			slightly over 3 seconds using the StringSet. The written file is 
			also slightly smaller than the input (by over 40% in some cases).
			.
			New in this version:
			.
			* Added a StringMap type, which should be more efficient than using TernaryMap String a
