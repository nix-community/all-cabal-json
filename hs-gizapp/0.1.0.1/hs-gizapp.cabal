synopsis:            Haskell wrapper around the GIZA++ toolkit.
description:         This provides a simple wrapper around the GIZA++ toolkit,
                     which is used for Statistical Machine Translation for
                     training IBM Models 1-5 and an HMM word alignment model.

                     GIZA++
                     .
