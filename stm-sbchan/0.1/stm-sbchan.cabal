name:               stm-sbchan
version:            0.1
synopsis:           Bounded channel for STM where item sizes can vary
description:
    This library provides a bounded first-in first-out channel type for use in
    STM.  It supports a limit on the /total size/ of items in the channel.
    .
    stm-sbchan also provides a few features not found in other bounded channel
    libraries, such as:
    .
        * Alternative overflow strategies @cramSBChan@ and @rollSBChan@.
          @cramSBChan@ ignores the channel's size limit, and @rollSBChan@
          removes old items from the beginning of the channel when it fills up.
    .
        * The channel limit can be adjusted at runtime.
