name:           swapper
version:        0.1
synopsis:       Transparently swapping data from in-memory structures to disk
description:
    This package provides a wrapper for functors, which allows their data to be
    automatically swapped to disk and loaded back when necessary. Although
    interaction with filesystem is required, whole interface (with exception of
    initialization) is pure and safe as long as no external manipulation with
    used database files happens while the program is running.

    Because only actual data, not indices (in Data.Map.Map, for example), are
    swapped and some accounting information are remembered for each item, this
    system is suitable mainly for situations where values are considerably
    larger then indices. Furthermore, creating complete snapshots to a file of
    this structure is supported; such snapshot can be then loaded, with
    individual values being read as they are requested.

    This package uses the Tokyo Cabinet <http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/>
    database, which needs to be installed on the system.

    A prototype of another data structure, SwapMap, is available in the git
    repository. It is similar to the Data.Map.Map and like Swapper allows
    transparent swapping of data to disk, but without requiring any accessory
    function and with the ability to swap both elements and indices. This one
    is, however, not complete and thus not provided here.
