Synopsis:        Stompl Client Library 
Description:
  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues. 
  Interoperating applications do not know 
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.

  .
  
  The Stomp Queue library provides 
  a Stomp client, using abstractions like
  'Connection', 'Transaction', 'Queue' and 'Message'.
  The library may use TLS for secure connections 
  to brokers that provide security over TLS.

  .

  More information, examples and a test suite are available 
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.
  The Stomp specification can be found at

  Release History:

  .

  [0.2.0] Changes:

          .

          - Low-level sockets were replaced by network-conduit-tls
            (Be aware that this change might introduce some
             subtle changes in behaviour concerning in particular 
             performance and connection handling)

          .

          - OMaxRecv not used anymore

          .

          - New Option OTLS for TLS connections

          .

          - New Option OTmo to specify a connection timeout

  .

  [0.1.4] Changes:

          . 

          - New: destroyReader and destroyWriter
  
          .

          - Patterns deprecated

  .

  [0.1.3] New Option for newWriter 'ONoContentLen'

  .

  [0.1.2] Minor changes:

          .

          - Dependency for stompl-0.1.1

          .

          - Some more enquiries into potential mem leaks,
            but more to follow

  .

  [0.1.1] Dependency for bytestring 0.10

  .

  [0.1.0] Major changes:

          .

          - Compliance with Stomp 1.2:

          .

          - There are major changes in the frame format,
            please refer to the documentation of the 
            stompl package, version 0.1.0, there are important changes
            that may impact messages for older versions!

          .

          - When generating an Ack frame,
            the /id/ header is by default taken from the /ack/ header
            in the corresponding Message frame.
            Should there be no /ack/ header or if its value is empty,
            the value of the header /message-id/ is taken.
            This behaviour complies with 1.2 
            for brokers supporting this version,
            but also continues to work with 1.1 brokers.

          .

          - It is now possible to send a Stomp frame
            to connect to a broker (the broker, of course,
            has to accept Stomp frames and process them correctly).
            There is a new Copt (/OStomp/) to support this feature.

  .

  [0.0.8] Client/Server on top of Queues.

  .

  [0.0.7] Fighting with hackagedb...

  .

  [0.0.6] Heartbeats caused a memory leak by creating 
          many Connection instances in the connection state list.
          The connections were lazily deleted, /i.e./ were
          not deleted at all.
          Connection state is now cleaned up by a strict delete.

  .

  [0.0.5] Major changes:
 
          .

          - Underscore functions (/withConnection_/) removed; 

          .

          - New /with*/ functions: /withWriter/, /withPair/;

          .

          - New option for connection (ClientId);

          .

          - Headers for broker-specific options can be passed to connection
            (this changes the /withConnection/ type signature!)

  .

  [0.0.3] New interface writeAdHoc

  .

  [0.0.2] Minor corrections
