Synopsis:        Stompl Client Library 
Description:
  The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.
  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)
  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues. 
  Interoperating applications do not know 
  the location or internal structure of each other.
  They see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages
  published and subscribed through the broker.
  
  The Stomp Queue library provides 
  a Stomp client, using abstractions like
  'Connection', 'Transaction', 'Queue' and 'Message'.

  More information, examples and a test suite are available 
  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.
  The Stomp specification can be found at
