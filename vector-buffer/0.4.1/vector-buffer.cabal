-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A buffer compatible with Data.Vector.*

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         
   A buffer type that can easily be converted to a Data.Vector.Storable vector
   from the vector package and compatible with hmatrix.
   .
   Elements are pushed into the buffer.  When the buffer is converted to a read-only
   vector, the last-pushed element occurs at the end.
   .
   Monadic map functions also operate so that the last-pushed element is treated last.
