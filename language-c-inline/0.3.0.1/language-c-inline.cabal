Version:                0.3.0.1
Cabal-version:          >= 1.9.2

Synopsis:               Inline C & Objective-C code in Haskell for language interoperability
Description:            This library provides inline C & Objective-C code using GHC's support for
                        quasi-quotation. In particular, it enables the use of foreign libraries
                        without a dedicated bridge or binding. Here is a tiny example:
                        .
                        > nslog :: String -> IO ()
                        > nslog msg = $(objc ['msg] ''() [cexp| NSLog(@"Here is a message from Haskell: %@", msg) |])
                        .
                        For more information, see <https://github.com/mchakravarty/language-c-inline/wiki>.
                        .

                        .
                        * New in 0.3.0.0: Boxed Haskell types without a dedicated type mapping are marshalled using stable
                        pointers.
                        .
                        * New in 0.2.0.0: Support for multiple free variables in one inline expression as well
                        as for inline code returning 'void'.
                        .
                        * New in 0.1.0.0: We are just getting started! This is just a ROUGH AND
                        HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE.
