name:                http-grammar
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Attoparsec-based parsers for the RFC-2616 HTTP grammar rules.
description:         The purpose of this package is to provide a faithful
                     implementation of the RFC-2616 HTTP grammar rules without
                     concession to popular deviations that "happen in the
                     wild".

                     The implementation is far from complete. My development
                     plan for this package is to add various productions from
                     time to time as I need them in other work I'm doing.

                     Contributions are most welcome and highly encouraged.
