synopsis:               The IO functions included in base delimited into small, composable classes
description:            An attempt to break up the monolithic IO monad into small, composable classes
                        that can be used to restrict a function to only having access to, say, functions
                        to work with the standard pipes, or a function that can access the environment.
                        The motivation for this library is to allow people to make a stricter contract
                        than simply "this function does IO", and express through the type system exactly
                        what IO is being performed.
