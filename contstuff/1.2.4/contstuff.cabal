Description:

    This library implements fast and easy to use CPS-based monad
    transformers.  Most of the usual monad transformers are implemented,
    including ChoiceT, ContT, EitherT, MaybeT and StateT.  Because of
    the design of this library, many other monad transformers are just
    special cases of those, including e.g. ReaderT and WriterT.

    The Control.ContStuff.Simple module also provides simplified monad
    transformer wrappers, which hide the underlying CPS, so you get the
    full performance, but with a simplified interface.  Currently the
    simplified monad transformers are implemented as type synonyms, so
    their flexibility is slightly limited.
