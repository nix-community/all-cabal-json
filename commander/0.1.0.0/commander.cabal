description:
    An extensible, format-agnostic command parsing library designed
    to be easy to use and syntactically light weight.
    .
    Assuming we write a parser to convert a command such as
    .
    @calculator add 1 2 -v=yes@
    .
    Into path and flags such as @["calculator", "add"]@ and @Map.fromList [("v","yes")]@,
    This library will then match said path and flags against a nested record type of
    commands built up using lightweight monadic syntax and tries to execute
    the associated function if the matching and value converting works, or returns
    an error if the path/flags fail to match any command.
    .
    To get started, see the documentation for the @Commander@ module
    below. Additionally, an /examples/ folder is included in the source
    illustrating usage - see https://github.com/jsdw/hs-commander for
    more.
