name:                canteven-config
version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            A pattern for configuring programs.
description:         Turns out, all of our executables shared the same sort of
                     pattern: Parse the command line to locate a config file,
                     read and parse the config file, set up `hslogger` based on
                     some stuff found in the config file, and pass the rest of
                     the config to the actual program. This library makes doing
                     that pattern super easy. It is meant to be a rather
                     particular (as opposed to general) solution for this sort
                     of problem.
