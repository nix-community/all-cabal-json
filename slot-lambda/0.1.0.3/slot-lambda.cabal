synopsis:            Write lambdas without naming the parameters.
description:         Write lambdas without naming the parameters. Example:   
                     .
                     @   
                        [s| ı : ı : _ı : ı : _ı : _ı : _0 : [] |] \'a\' \'b\' \'c\'
                     =  (\\x y z -> x:y:y:z:z:z:x:[]) \'a\' \'b\' \'c\'
                     =  \"abbccca\"
                     @
                     .
                     The unicode character @ı@(U+0131, not the number @1@!) representing a \'slot\' can be input in vim with the digraph \'i.\' . @_ı@ stands for the same argument as the immediate left @ı@ does.
                     Any suggestions of another unicode character in the 'Letter, Lowercase' category that 
							.
							1)no one would use as a variable name, and 
							.
							2)can be easily input in vim 
							.
							are welcome.
                     You can also use @_0@,@_1@,@_2@,... to refer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... arguments.
                     .
                     Just @import Syntax.Slot@ and use either @[s| ... |]@ or @[slot| ... |]@, which are the same thing given two names for convenience.
