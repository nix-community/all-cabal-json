Name:                phooey
Version:             2.0
Synopsis: 	     Functional user interfaces
Category:            User Interfaces
Description:
  Phooey is a library for functional UIs, providing three different
  functional interfaces: Monad, Applicative, and Arrow.  See the
  correspondingly named modules in the list below.  The other modules are
  exposed for extensibility.
  .
  Try out the examples in @src\/Examples\/@.
  .
  Because this library uses reactive, compile apps with @-threaded@.
