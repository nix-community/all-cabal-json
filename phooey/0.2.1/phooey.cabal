Synopsis: 	     Functional user interfaces
Category:            User Interfaces
Description:
  Phooey is a library for functional UIs.
  .
  If you just want to /use/ Phooey, see the main module below
  ("Graphics.UI.Phooey").  The other modules (@UI.Graphics.Phooey.*@) are
  useful for understanding the implementation and adding new features.
