name:               unicoder
version:            0.5.0
stability:          beta
synopsis:           Make writing in unicode easy.
description:        Unicoder is a command-line tool transforms text documents, replacing simple
                    patterns with unicode equivalents. The patterns can be easily configured by
                    the user.
                    This package is especially meant to open the vast and expressive array
                    of unicode identifiers to programmers and language designers, but there's
                    nothing wrong with a technically savvy user putting unicoder to work
                    on documents for human consumption.
                    Any system of special characters can be made easy to type on any keyboard 
                    and in any context as long as unicode supports it.
                    .
                    Cabal wants to fight me over typesetting some examples, so check out
                    <http://zankoku-okuno.viewdocs.io/unicoder/ the real docs>
                    for a decent look at the features.
                    .
                    In the interests of giving readers /some/ idea whats going on,
                    with the default settings,
                    .
                    > \E.x. \A.y. x \-> y
                    > \l.x,y. x \of x \of y
                    .
                    becomes
                    .
                    > ∃x ∀y x → y
                    > λx,y. x ∘ x ∘ y
                    .
                    except that the newline isn't removed (thanks, cabal!). Also, there are a couple
                    important features that I can't seem to get cabal to even parse (thanks again!).
