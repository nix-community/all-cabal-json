description:
    The units package provides a mechanism for compile-time dimensional analysis
    in Haskell programs. It defines an embedded type system based on
    units-of-measure. The units defined are fully extensible, and need not relate
    to physical properties. In fact, the core package defines only one built-in
    unit: Scalar. The package supports defining multiple inter-convertible units,
    such as Meter and Foot. When extracting a number from a dimensioned quantity,
    the desired unit must be specified, and the value is converted into that unit.

    The Haddock documentation is insufficient for using the units package. Please
    see the README file, available from the package home page.
