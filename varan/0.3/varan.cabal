Synopsis:      Process mpileup output to identify significant differences
Description:   Using Agresti-Coull estimation of confidence interval, report
	       variant positions found in pooled samples along with significance of
	       the variant having different underlying allele frequency ('+' for 95%, 
	       '*' for 99%).
