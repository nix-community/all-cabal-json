Version:             0.1.0.0
Synopsis:            HERMIT plugin for optimizing Scrap-Your-Boilerplate traversals.
Description:
  A HERMIT plugin for GHC which optimizes SYB generic traversals to achieve equivalent performance to hand-written traversals.
  .
  Details can be found in the paper: <http://michaeldadams.org/papers/syb-opt/>
  .
  Note: This compiler plugin requires GHC 7.8 (or HEAD) and specially compiled copies of base, ghc-prim, and syb.
  Up-to-date instructions can be found at: <https://github.com/ku-fpg/hermit/wiki/GHC-HEAD>. We are working to
  lift these requirements.
  .
  As an example, we apply the optimization to Foo.hs, which contains the following code:
  .
  @
   module Main where
   .
   import Data.Generics
   import HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude
   .
   main :: IO ()
   main = print (mapInt (+1) [1..10])
   .
   mapInt :: (Int -> Int) -> [Int] -> [Int]
   mapInt f = everywhere (mkT f)
  @
  .
  Note that importing @HERMIT.Optimization.SYB.Prelude@ is required in any module targeted for optimization.
  .
  To compile Foo.hs with the optimization:
  .
  @
   $ hermit Foo.hs -opt=HERMIT.Optimization.SYB +Main mapInt
  @
  .
  This invokes GHC with a specific set of flags. These flags may be used instead of the 'hermit' program itself, or placed in a cabal file.
  .
  The first argument to HERMIT is the target file. Next is the -opt flag, which specifies the plugin name. 
  Then follows one or more target module names, each beginning with a plus sign. After each target module is a list of targeted functions.
  The distinguished 'interactive' target will run the optimization on any other targets and then enter the HERMIT interactive shell.
  The distinguished 'interactive-only' target will open the HERMIT shell before optimization. 
  HERMIT commands specific to this optimization are available for interactive use.
